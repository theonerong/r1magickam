Include typical prom decorations such as metallic balloons, crepe paper, tinsel, streamers, and a banner with the school name and graduation year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a generic school name and year).\n\nDress all subjects in unmistakably tacky 1980s prom attire.

Hairstyles must be exaggerated and era-accurate: big teased hair, feathered bangs, mullets, perms, or excessive hairspray volume.\n\nSubject logic:\n• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears masculine, add an older woman who plausibly looks like the subject’s mother as the prom date. She should be dressed formally but slightly out of place.\n• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears feminine, add a younger boy who plausibly looks like a younger brother as the prom date. He should appear underdressed or uncomfortable.\n• If there are TWO human subjects, present them as prom dates together, standing close but visibly awkward, stiff, or uncomfortable.\n\nBody language should feel forced and uncomfortable: stiff smiles, arms held too rigidly, hands awkwardly placed, or obvious personal space tension. No one should look confident or natural.\n\nEnsure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed prom photo.

If master prompt text is provided, incorporate that text as the inscription on the coin - either around the rim, below the portrait, or as the motto. If no master prompt text is provided, use traditional coin phrases like denomination, year, country name, or Latin phrases ('E PLURIBUS UNUM', 'IN GOD WE TRUST'). Include decorative borders, stars, or laurel wreaths. The coin style can vary from ancient Roman/Greek coins with profile emperors, to medieval coins with crowned monarchs, to modern presidential coins with contemporary styling. Include authentic numismatic details: edge ridges (reeding), metallic patina or tarnish, slight wear showing age, that characteristic coin relief depth. The entire composition should be circular showing the full coin face. Use realistic metal textures - reflective highlights on raised surfaces, shadows in recessed areas, authentic metallic sheen. Make it look like an actual photographed commemorative or currency coin with the subject immortalized as the featured portrait, whether ancient artifact or modern minting."

Show them doing exaggerated, awkward, out-of-rhythm dance moves with complete confidence - finger guns, lawnmower move, shopping cart, sprinkler, or other classic dad moves. They should be wearing typical dad attire - tucked-in polo shirt, khakis or cargo shorts, white New Balance sneakers, maybe a fanny pack. Place them at a wedding reception, school dance, or family party. Include mortified teenagers (presumably their kids) in the background covering their faces, other dads joining in enthusiastically, and normal dancers clearing space around the dad dance zone. The subject should have pure joy and zero self-awareness on their face. Add disco ball lighting, DJ booth, or party decorations. Capture that specific energy of dads who dance like nobody's watching despite everyone definitely watching. Make it look like a candid photo of maximum dad embarrassment caught mid-dance move."

The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window.\"\n  - 75: \"If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in your act, I don't think it's a good idea to also dress the dog up like a clown, because people see that and think, 'Forgive me, but that's just too much.'\"\n  - 76: \"If you're ever stuck in some thick undergrowth, in your underwear, don't stop and think of what other words have 'under' in them, because that's probably the first sign of jungle madness.\"\n  - 77: \"When this girl at the art museum asked me whom I liked better, Monet or Manet, I said, 'I like mayonnaise.' She just stared at me, so I said it again, louder. Then she left. I guess she went to try to find some mayonnaise for me.\"\n  - 78: \"I remember how the other kids used to say that old Mister Swenson was the meanest man in town.

Now that's a documentary!\"\n  - 81: \"One thing a computer can do that most humans can't is be sealed up in a cardboard box and sit in a warehouse.\"\n  - 82: \"How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol? How about the pillow? It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have that dangerous beak.\"\n  - 83: \"If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say, 'I swallowed it. So sue me.'\"\n  - 84: \"Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion the tiger, or even the elephant. It's a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything they see.\"\n  - 85: \"Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a very beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk.\"\n  - 86: \"To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion. Truth is real. And, at the same time, unreal. Fiction and fact and everything in between, plus some things I can't remember, all rolled into one big 'thing'. This is truth, to me.\"\n  - 87: \"Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham! you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, 'Think again, bat man.'\"\n  - 88: \"I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fisherman caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark, there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy–something like that.\"\n  - 89: \"At first, I thought if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be 'Clark Kent, Dentist,' because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, 'How's my back tooth?' and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, 'Oh it's okay,' then the patient would probably say, 'Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?' and you'd say, 'I did,' and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill.\"\n  - 90: \"If you're having a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, 'Boy, these are good cigars!'\"\n  - 91: \"The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength for me. I remember we'd all pile into the car – I forget what kind it was – and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called 'Dad.' We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you.\"\n  - 92: \"One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't run with wooden stakes.\"\n  - 93: \"For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?\"\n  - 94: \"If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.\"\n  - 95: \"Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.\"\n  - 96: \"When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.\"\n  - 97: \"I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint.\"\n  - 98: \"The funny thing about a person driving off a cliff is that they probably have their foot on the brake.

Add printing imperfections: ink smudging, lighter sections where ribbon was fading, slight horizontal line patterns from print head movement, occasional missing dots from dead pins. The image should have very low resolution appearance - approximately 72-180 DPI equivalent, with all details reduced to dot patterns.

    message: "Take a picture and transform it into a vibrant 3D layered pop art composition with multiple raised paper-cut levels creating extreme visual depth at miniature scale.\n\nStyle characteristics: Ultra-bright saturated colors with bold black outlines, flat color fills with minimal shading, playful exaggerated proportions and perspectives. The aesthetic should resemble colorful painted cardstock or screen-printed paper sheets stacked at different heights, rendered with realistic miniature scale and physical dimensionality.\n\nLayering structure: Divide the scene into at least 5-7 distinct depth levels with strong cast shadows between each layer emphasizing the sculptural three-dimensional quality.\n\nCRITICAL - PACK THE SCENE WITH MINIATURES: Fill every inch of the composition with abundant miniature elements densely arranged: tiny buildings with architectural details, miniature cars and vehicles, small-scale people figures, street signs, storefronts, windows, decorative patterns, architectural ornaments, repeating shapes, whimsical embellishments, busy textures, trees, street lamps, and countless playful visual elements. The scene should feel like a bustling miniature cityscape or metropolitan diorama with an overwhelming joyful abundance of tiny detailed objects all bunched together. No empty space - every area should be filled with miniature sculptural elements.\n\nThe diorama MUST be constructed exclusively from elements present in the actual photographed scenery OR the location explicitly specified in the master prompt.\n\nDO NOT invent a different city, skyline, or landmarks.\n\nIf the subject is in Miami, the diorama must reflect Miami.\nIf Las Vegas, Las Vegas.\nIf no location is provided, use ONLY the visible environment from the original image.\n\nAll buildings, streets, signage, vehicles, and scenery must be derived from the real environment and reinterpreted in layered, sculptural form.\n\nThe subject MUST appear as a FULL miniature human figure within the diorama — even if only a torso, head, or partial body was visible in the original photo.\n\nThe subject should be scaled down appropriately and integrated into the environment like a physical figurine.\n\nUse layered depth, bright colors, paper-cut textures, stacked elements, and playful perspective.\n\nThe final image must look like a physical 3D pop-art diorama constructed from the real location — not a generic city illustration.\n\nCRITICAL - SUBJECT SCALE: Transform the subject into a three-dimensional miniature figure within this densely packed layered diorama at the EXACT SAME SMALL SCALE as all other miniature elements. The subject must be proportionally sized to match the tiny buildings, miniature cars, and small people figures surrounding them - NOT larger or more prominent. If buildings are 2-3 inches tall in the miniature scene, the subject figure should be appropriately scaled (roughly 1 inch or smaller if representing a person). The subject should appear as ONE SMALL ELEMENT among many in the busy cityscape, not dominating the composition. They must have physical depth and dimension like a detailed figurine, integrated naturally among all other miniatures at consistent scale.\n\nThe final result should look like a physical framed miniature diorama or shadow box photographed straight-on, showcasing vibrant metropolitan energy with extreme visual depth, realistic three-dimensional construction, CONSISTENT miniature scale throughout with the subject properly sized to match all surrounding elements, overwhelming joyful abundance of densely packed tiny details, and clear dimensional separation between layers. Everything - including the subject - should appear as real miniature sculptural objects at the same small scale, bunched together in a busy, celebratory cityscape."

The environment should capture Burton's distinctive aesthetic: twisted architecture, spiraling designs, forced perspective, gothic elements mixed with whimsy, stark contrast between light and shadow, surreal proportions, and his signature color palette.\n\nThe subject should be styled as if they belong in that specific Burton film. Preserve recognizable features while adapting them to Burton's exaggerated, slightly macabre artistic vision.\n\nLighting should be dramatic with strong contrasts - deep shadows, pools of light, moonlit scenes, or that distinctive Burton glow. The atmosphere should feel both whimsical and slightly dark, fantastical yet melancholic.\n\nThe final image should look like an actual still from a Tim Burton film - gothic, whimsical, visually striking, with exaggerated proportions and that unmistakable Burton aesthetic. The subject should be seamlessly integrated into the film's world alongside other iconic characters from that movie."

There must be NO underlying full-size face, skin, or body visible anywhere.

The tiny versions should act like living building blocks, posed and arranged to define edges, shading, and structure. From a distance, the subject must read clearly as a complete human figure; up close, the image must resolve entirely into individual miniature subjects. Use consistent lighting and perspective so the construction feels intentional, surreal, and visually mind-bending.
