Analyze the subject and environment and apply the following transformations:

• If the primary subject appears feminine, transform them into a Barbie doll.
• If the primary subject appears masculine, transform them into a Ken doll.

The doll’s face should retain the subject’s recognizable facial structure, proportions, and expression, but be rendered with smooth plastic skin, simplified features, glossy eyes, and the polished look of a physical Barbie or Ken toy.

Environmental logic:
• If the scene appears indoors, place the subject inside a Barbie Dreamhouse interior with pastel-colored plastic furniture, toy-like proportions, and miniature physical details.
• If the scene appears outdoors, place the subject inside or next to a Barbie convertible with realistic toy textures, bright colors, and a glossy finish.

- If failed, leave large portions blank, replaced by placeholder space, broken image icons, or alt-text-style text.
- If retrying, show uneven clarity with duplicated or misaligned segments. Preserve the subject’s recognizable features even when incomplete. Simulate authentic early-internet artifacts such as compression noise, color banding, abrupt resolution jumps, and unstable alignment.

Generate the honorary title dynamically using humorous flavor text derived from the subject’s traits, pose, expression, clothing, or environment.

If the room appears messy or cluttered, transform it into a clean, organized version of the same space. Remove clutter, straighten objects, clean surfaces, neatly arrange items, and improve overall order while preserving the original layout, furniture, and lighting.

If the room appears clean or orderly, transform it into a realistically messy version. Add believable clutter such as scattered clothes, papers, cups, toys, or everyday items. Introduce mild disorder without destroying the room or making it unsafe.

The subject’s entire form — head, body, limbs, and features — must be constructed exclusively from cloud matter. Do not show skin, clothing, solid surfaces, or mixed materials. The subject must not appear inside clouds; the subject itself is the cloud. The overall cloud shape must follow the subject’s silhouette, posture, and proportions. The subject’s outline governs the form. Determine the cloud type as follows: If the subject is animate (person or animal), select the cloud type based on the subject’s apparent emotion: – Happy or playful → Cumulus (bright, puffy, well-defined) – Sad, tired, or withdrawn → Nimbostratus (heavy, low, rain-filled) – Angry, intense, or aggressive → Cumulonimbus (towering, dense, storm-like) – Calm or neutral → Stratus (smooth, layered, subdued) If the subject is inanimate, use Altocumulus clouds with a neutral, evenly spaced texture. Use cloud density, lighting, internal shadow, and volume to imply facial features, limbs, and expression without outlines or solid edges. Avoid solid ground unless contextually appropriate. Use sky gradients, mist, or distant horizons to support the illusion. Ensure the silhouette remains readable on a small screen.

The final image must show the **entire badge fully visible** within the frame, oriented vertically or horizontally like a real workplace ID. Include realistic badge proportions, rounded corners, clip hole or lanyard slot, and slight plastic glare or lamination texture. The badge should appear photographed or scanned flat, not floating in space.

Place the subject’s photo in a standard ID photo area. The portrait should look like a real badge photo: neutral lighting, centered framing, simple background, and mild compression or sharpening typical of office badges.

Include the following badge details, all rendered clearly and legibly:
• **Employee Name:** Generate a humorous but plausible name based on the subject’s appearance, expression, or clothing (unless overridden by external master prompt).
• **Job Title:** Create a funny or exaggerated job title inspired by the subject’s visible traits or environment (e.g., "Senior Snack Analyst," "Head of Vibes," "Chief Button Presser").
• **Employee ID Number:** Use a fictional numeric or alphanumeric code.
• **Department:** Optional, humorous department name derived from context.

Include a **company name and logo**:
• If a real company logo or branding is visible in the image, adapt the logo.
• If a company name or logo is provided via external master prompt, use that name and create a believable logo mark to match.

Add small realistic badge elements such as barcodes, QR codes, issue dates, expiration dates, or security stripes. Text should look official but contain subtle humor when read closely.

Reduce the image to a clean line-art outline that captures the essential shape and silhouette of the subject while removing unnecessary detail.

Place numbered dots along the outline and key interior contours in a **logical sequential order starting with number 1**, so that connecting the dots in order will clearly reveal the subject. Dots should be large, evenly spaced, and easy to follow.

Show very minimal lines or connecting guides—only enough to hint at the outline if necessary, but primarily rely on the numbered dots. Avoid background details, shading, or other guides. Use high-contrast dots suitable for printing. Do not include text, instructions, or labels.

The final image must resemble a single sheet of copier paper viewed flat and fully visible within the frame, including paper edges and margins. Do not crop the page.

The subject should appear distorted from being pressed against the glass: flattened features, slightly squashed face or objects, widened nose, compressed cheeks, stretched hands or fingers, and uneven contact areas. The distortion should feel physical and silly, not warped digitally.

Apply classic photocopier artifacts: harsh black-and-white or muddy grayscale tones, blown highlights, crushed shadows, toner speckling, faint streaks, edge shadows from the copier lid, uneven exposure, and slight skew or rotation. Include faint dust marks or smudges typical of a well-used office copier.

Lighting should feel internal to the copier — flat, overexposed, and directionless — not like studio lighting. The background should be blank or show subtle shadows from the copier lid.

Optionally include a small copier interface imprint or margin text such as page numbers, contrast indicators, or misaligned registration marks, rendered faintly and partially cut off.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the subject’s pose (e.g., face, hands, object pressed to glass) or tone of humor.

The subject should appear calm, neutral, or unintentionally serious, regardless of how absurd the final message is.

Select ONE original 'Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey' quote and present it as the affirmation text. The humor should come from the contrast between the sincere visual tone and the unexpectedly absurd or philosophical text.

Compose the image simply and cleanly: the subject centered or thoughtfully framed, with the quote displayed clearly beneath or overlaid in an understated font. Do not explain the joke. Do not exaggerate expressions. Let the humor remain dry and subtle.

Ensure the entire image and text are fully visible and easily readable on a small screen.

Render the subject’s face as an engraved-style portrait suitable for currency printing. Preserve recognizable facial structure and expression, but translate it into fine linework, cross-hatching, and stippling so it looks printed, not photographic. The portrait should feel integrated into the bill design, not pasted on.

Design the bill with traditional currency elements:
• Ornamental borders and scrollwork
• Decorative frames and rosettes
• Serial numbers (fictional)
• Treasury-style seals (parody, non-official)
• Micro-pattern textures and guilloché lines

Replace all real-world identifiers with humorous equivalents:
• Use a fictional denomination (e.g., "$1 DOLLAR BOB," "$3 DOLLAR BOB," "$100 DOLLAR BOB")
• Replace national mottos with absurd or playful phrases inspired by the subject’s traits or posture
• Include a humorous title beneath the portrait instead of a real name (e.g., "In Snacks We Trust," "Certified Snack Authority")

Color palette should resemble classic green-and-black currency ink on aged paper. Add subtle wear such as folds, creases, ink bleed, or slight yellowing for realism.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the denomination, slogan, title, or tone of the bill.

All text, seals, and symbols must be clearly fictional and parody-based.

Maintain natural neck alignment and correct scale so each swapped head fits the new body believably.

If exactly one subject is detected, perform an inverse face transformation by subtly mirroring or inverting the subject’s facial features while preserving overall realism, expression, and identity. The result should feel intentionally uncanny but not distorted.

If no subjects are detected, return the original image unchanged. The final image should be visually coherent and readable on small screens.`},{name:"FRIDGE ART",category:["ART","HUMOR","NAIVE","CHILD LIKE"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a child’s crayon drawing displayed on a refrigerator.

Render the subject as a deliberately crude crayon drawing with uneven proportions, simple shapes, wobbly outlines, and flat scribbled coloring. Facial features and limbs should be exaggerated or misaligned in a childlike way while still being loosely recognizable.

Use a plain white or lightly stained paper background with visible crayon texture and pressure marks. Add misspelled handwritten text such as a name, age, or caption written in childlike lettering.

Attach the drawing to a refrigerator using colorful magnets. Show part of the fridge surface, smudges, and nearby papers or photos.

The subject should lie flush on the frosting surface — fully integrated — but the frosting itself should have realistic texture: piped swirls, slight ridges, creaminess, and subtle shadows so it clearly looks like real icing, not a topper.

Render the subject simply, preserving only the most recognizable facial features, posture, or silhouette. Avoid overly detailed or three-dimensional features; the design should be believable as hand-piped or painted frosting.

Include realistic cake decorations such as frosting borders, small swirls, sprinkles, or minor fondant accents. If no external message is provided via master prompt, automatically add playful flavor text based on the subject: e.g., 'Happy 1st Birthday!' if the subject appears young, or 'Happy Retirement!' if the subject appears older.

If an external message is provided, append it naturally using piping-style lettering around the subject. Ensure the full cake top and subject are fully visible in the frame.

Convert the subject into true dot-matrix pixel art using a visible grid of circular pixels, limited tonal steps, and strong contrast. Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features and silhouette while adapting them to the constraints of a handheld screen resolution. Simulate real screen characteristics including pixel ghosting, motion blur trails, uneven refresh, slight vertical smearing, faint scan artifacts, and subtle screen noise. Avoid smooth gradients—everything should appear quantized and grid-based. Frame the image strictly as the handheld screen view itself, with a thin dark border suggesting the screen edge. Do not include logos, branding, or copyrighted UI elements. Optional minimal pixel indicators (numbers or icons only) may appear at the edges of the screen. Optimize for small screens with bold shapes, clear separation, and immediate readability.

Write ONE short horoscope message based on the subject’s visible traits, expression, posture, clothing, or situation. The horoscope must be humorous, blunt, and confidently ridiculous — it should sound specific, obvious, and completely unserious.

Use flavor text to exaggerate mundane or trivial traits (e.g., procrastination, overconfidence, distraction, stubbornness) as if they are unavoidable cosmic truths. Avoid mystical language, poetic ambiguity, or generic fortune-cookie phrasing.

If additional text such as a name, address, phone number, or tagline is provided externally, render that text as literal, readable typography arranged neatly beneath or beside the logo symbol. Maintain clear separation between the logo mark and supporting text.

Apply a minimal, modern design style suitable for headers or branding: balanced proportions, restrained color usage, and clear negative space. Avoid illustrative complexity, mascots, or decorative effects. The final result should resemble a legitimate logo-and-header lockup suitable for professional use.`},{name:"LONG EXPOSURE",category:["PHOTOGRAPHY","MOTION","BLUR"],message:"Take a picture and apply long-exposure photography style.

Preserve clear facial likeness and identity while presenting the subject in a quiet, sincere moment. Design constraint: Render a single image split into exactly two side-by-side panels of equal size. In each panel, show the subject holding one handwritten sign facing the viewer. Limit the total number of signs to a maximum of two, with one short line of text per sign. Do not imply motion, animation, or time-based progression. Primary information source: If message text is provided via externally supplied details, divide the message across the two signs. Ensure the wording is original, natural, and emotionally resonant, and does not reference or recreate any specific copyrighted scene, dialogue, or characters. Secondary enhancement: If no message text is provided, infer a gentle, original two-line message based on the subject’s expression and context. Optimize the layout for small screens with bold, high-contrast handwritten text, clean spacing, and minimal clutter. Use soft, cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field, and a warm, intimate tone.

Render the subject fully in balloon form — all features, including hair, clothing, and accessories, should appear as smooth, glossy, inflated balloons. Use tubular, rounded, or segment-like shapes typical of balloon sculpture. Exaggerate facial features slightly for comedic effect while keeping the subject recognizable.

Include parade context: ropes, handlers, and a city street environment to show scale. Ensure the balloon is fully visible, oversized, and clearly readable on a small screen.

The mascot must appear as a physical, wearable suit with a large oversized mascot head, visible seams, plush or foam textures, and costume proportions typical of real stadium mascots.

Preserve the subject’s recognizable traits by translating facial characteristics into the mascot head design, not by using the real face. Eyes, mouth, and expression should be part of the costume head.

Use photoreal lighting and materials so the mascot looks like a real person wearing a professional mascot suit, not a cartoon or illustration. Place the mascot in a stadium, field, or arena environment.

Ensure the full mascot body is visible and properly proportioned.

Include toy-accurate removable parts such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, ears, arms, and accessories (hat, glasses, etc.). Arrange them on the potato body in a playful, semi-realistic way that preserves the subject’s identity while emphasizing the modular, interchangeable nature of the toy.

Maintain proper scale, shadows, and lighting so the subject appears as a real physical toy. Do not add text or background clutter; keep the composition clean and readable on small screens.

Avoid obvious repetition. Vary posture, head tilt, facial expression, or interaction with the environment so each duplicate feels intentional. Keep the composition readable on a small screen.

Analyze the number of visible subjects:
• If multiple subjects are present, show all but one touching their index finger to their nose in a synchronized, quick-reaction pose.
• One subject should clearly be "too late" — their finger either not yet touching their nose, hovering just short, or their hand still moving — making it obvious they are now "it."

Body language and facial expressions are critical:
• The non-it subjects should look relieved, smug, amused, or triumphant.
• The subject who is "it" should look surprised, annoyed, resigned, or caught off-guard.

Ensure everyone remains in the same moment in time, as if the action was frozen immediately after the call of "Not it!" No motion blur — clarity is more important than realism.

Do not add text, arrows, or labels. The concept must be communicated purely through pose, gesture, and expression.

Match lighting, perspective, and scale so the scene feels like a candid photo capturing a spontaneous social moment. Keep the composition readable on a small screen, with all hands and faces clearly visible.`},{name:"NURSERY RHYME STORYBOOK",category:["STORYBOOK","KIDS","LESSON"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into the main character of a classic nursery rhyme.

Transform the subject accordingly so they appear fully integrated into the nursery rhyme world — not posing on top of it. Costumes, props, environment, and proportions should make the subject look like they belong inside the story.

Render the scene in a whimsical, illustrated storybook style with soft colors, painterly textures, gentle lighting, and classic children’s book charm. Avoid modern objects or settings unless intentionally playful.

Include the **title of the nursery rhyme** prominently and clearly at the top or bottom of the image. Display a **short, complete version of the nursery rhyme text** within the scene in large, legible lettering, styled like a storybook page. All text must be fully visible and readable.

Every facial feature, contour, shadow, and body shape must be defined only by the placement, color, density, and orientation of the objects. From a distance, the subject must be clearly recognizable; up close, the image must resolve entirely into individual objects.

Replace the traditional game head with the subject’s head, adapted into a flat, illustrated style that matches the board aesthetic while remaining recognizable. Integrate humorous, fictional items into the body cavities inspired by the subject’s traits or environment (e.g., snacks, phone, keys, coffee cup, tangled thoughts). Items should be cartoonish and clearly readable.

Instead, recreate the setting, era-appropriate environment, clothing, and atmosphere so the moment is immediately identifiable through visual context alone. Use implicit inference from the subject’s appearance, posture, and expression to select an appropriate historic theme (e.g., leadership, discovery, courage, progress, unity). If externally provided details are supplied, incorporate them as factual context for the moment. Present the image as a clean, collectible flashcard optimized for small screens.

Do not alter or contradict known historical associations. Secondary enhancement: Use implicit visual inference from the subject’s appearance, clothing, accessories, environment, and expression to enhance symbolism, visual motifs, and flavor text, without overriding factual saint information. Fallback behavior: If no saint name is externally provided, create a clearly labeled symbolic or archetypal “Saint of [inferred theme]” based on implicit inference from the subject. Avoid naming or implying a real historical saint, omit specific feast dates, and present patronage and fun facts as symbolic rather than historical.

Preserve just enough of the subject’s pose, silhouette, and key features so the intended idea is still recognizable, but clearly simplified into crude line art rather than a realistic portrait.

Optional visual cues may be included sparingly, such as motion lines, arrows, or simple icons (e.g., sweat drops, exclamation marks) to suggest action or intent, as commonly seen in Pictionary drawings.

Do NOT include written words, letters, numbers, labels, or clues. The image must rely entirely on the drawing to communicate the idea.

Ensure the subject appears printed on the cover itself, not floating above it, with realistic lighting, paper texture, slight wear, and subtle printing imperfections. Add stage-themed design elements such as curtains, spotlights, marquee lights, or silhouettes to reinforce the theatrical setting.

Include humorous or over-the-top flavor text describing the subject’s role or performance (e.g., 'A One-Person Musical About Snacks,' 'Winner of Seven Imaginary Awards'). All text should be legible and balanced for small screens.

Depict the subject as a hand-drawn pencil or charcoal sketch on off-white paper, using strong line work, cross-hatching, and shading to define facial structure and key features.

Simplify and alter details so the sketch is approximate rather than an exact replica of the subject. Preserve general identifying characteristics such as face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hairline, and expression, but introduce small deviations consistent with a sketch from memory.

Use a neutral background with slight paper texture. Add text and police case numbers.

Surround the illustration with aged, yellowed paper showing foxing, stains, and worn edges typical of 1730s–1750s printed almanacs.

Include period-accurate typography using blackletter or colonial serif fonts for headers. Feature a famous Benjamin Franklin saying or proverb prominently on the page in large, clear text, such as 'Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,' 'A penny saved is a penny earned,' or 'Well done is better than well said.' Ensure this saying is the **most prominent text element** and fully visible.

Optionally, add small marginal notes, weather predictions, or astronomical observations in smaller text around the edges. Include decorative borders, flourishes, and printer's ornaments typical of colonial printing. Render realistic ink impressions, slight printing misalignments, and other subtle imperfections to emulate a true 18th-century printed page.

Place the page fully within the frame with a relevant background behind it.

Show the open book with two facing pages visible. The pop-up elements should clearly originate from the folds of the pages and extend upward, as if they would collapse flat when the book is closed.

Use realistic paper textures, visible creases, cut edges, and paper thickness. All materials must look like paper—no skin, fabric, plastic, or realistic surfaces. Lighting and shadows should emphasize the layered paper construction.

The subject must be holding a clearly visible protest sign with a humorous, absurd, or lighthearted message inspired by the subject’s appearance, posture, expression, or surrounding context. The message should be playful and harmless (e.g., 'More Snacks, Less Responsibilities,' 'Justice for Left Socks,' 'End Meetings That Could’ve Been Emails'). The exact wording may be influenced by external flavor text or master prompts.

Ensure the sign looks authentic: handmade poster board or cardboard, bold marker lettering, slightly uneven edges, realistic hand grip, and natural perspective distortion. The sign text must be fully readable and entirely visible within the frame.

The environment should resemble a real protest setting (street, park, plaza, sidewalk) with believable crowd density, natural lighting, candid body language, and realistic depth of field. Avoid political slogans, symbols, or identifiable political figures.

The subject should not be isolated or overly centered — they should feel discovered within the crowd. Clothing, expressions, and posture should appear spontaneous and believable.

Generate a QR-code-like pattern where the arrangement of black-and-white modules visually encodes the subject’s face, silhouette, or key shapes when viewed as a whole. From a distance, the QR code should subtly resemble the subject; up close, it should read as a dense matrix of square blocks.

Do NOT attempt to generate a functional or scannable QR code. This is a visual interpretation only.

Optionally integrate small visual cues inspired by QR codes, such as alignment squares or finder patterns, while keeping the overall pattern artistically abstract and non-functional.
