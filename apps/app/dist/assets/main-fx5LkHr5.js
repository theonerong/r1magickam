Introduce obvious 3D-printing failures such as warped or shifted layers, missing sections, drooping filament, collapsed overhangs, stringing, and incomplete geometry as if the print stopped or misaligned mid-job.

The subject should appear as a photographed 3D print sitting on a workbench or print bed, with realistic shadows, shallow depth of field, and neutral lighting. Use a single solid filament color or limited two-color print. Avoid smooth, sculpted, or digital-rendered surfaces. The final image must clearly look like a failed physical 3D print, not a CGI model or statue.`},{name:"80s AND 90s ACTION FILMS",category:["HUMOR","MOVIE","SCENE","ACTION"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them into a scene from a classic 1980s or 1990s action film, such as *Die Hard*, *Lethal Weapon*, *Terminator*, or *Speed*.

The subject should appear as the action hero or main participant, performing a dramatic stunt, holding a weapon, or interacting with the environment in an exaggerated way.

Props, lighting, and costumes should match the era and style of the film, including explosions, helicopters, cars, or city backdrops.

Optional flavor text from the master prompt can add humorous twists, like awkward poses, improbable stunts, or ridiculous expressions.

The final image should look like a cinematic action movie still with the subject as the star, funny, dramatic, and larger-than-life.`},{name:"80s PROM DATE",category:["RETRO","HUMOR","PHOTOGRAPHY","POP CULTURE"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into an awkward 1980s prom photo taken at a high school prom.

The image should look like a posed flash photograph from the 1980s: harsh on-camera flash, flat lighting, soft focus, slight film grain, and muted color tones. Include typical prom decorations such as metallic balloons, crepe paper, tinsel, streamers, and a banner with the school name and graduation year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a generic school name and year).

Dress all subjects in unmistakably tacky 1980s prom attire. Examples include oversized tuxedos, pastel or ruffled dresses, lace gloves, corsages, bow ties, cummerbunds, sequins, and shiny fabrics. Hairstyles must be exaggerated and era-accurate: big teased hair, feathered bangs, mullets, perms, or excessive hairspray volume.

Subject logic:
• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears masculine, add an older woman who plausibly looks like the subject’s mother as the prom date. She should be dressed formally but slightly out of place.
• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears feminine, add a younger boy who plausibly looks like a younger brother as the prom date. He should appear underdressed or uncomfortable.
• If there are TWO human subjects, present them as prom dates together, standing close but visibly awkward, stiff, or uncomfortable.

Body language should feel forced and uncomfortable: stiff smiles, arms held too rigidly, hands awkwardly placed, or obvious personal space tension. No one should look confident or natural.

Ensure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed prom photo. The final image should feel painfully nostalgic, humorously awkward, and unmistakably 1980s — readable and funny on a small screen.`},{name:"AI-BUY",category:["UTILITY","AI","SHOPPING"],message:"Analyze the image and identify purchasable items.

Secondary enhancement: If no product details are externally provided, infer a plausible featured product based on what the subject is visibly holding, wearing, or using. If inference is required, keep the product generic and clearly implied rather than naming a specific real-world brand. Design the final image as a compact, mobile-friendly magazine advertisement layout optimized for small screens. Include a bold, high-contrast headline or slogan, a short block of engaging flavor text, and subtle supporting copy if space allows. Ensure all text is legible at small sizes with clean spacing and strong visual hierarchy. Use flattering, high-quality lighting, refined composition, and a modern editorial aesthetic.

Depict the subject as a story character (human or animal) fully integrated into a classic fable scene, not as a modern person placed into an illustration. The environment, props, and other characters should visually support the chosen fable.

Render the image as a single illustrated storybook page. Ensure the entire page is fully visible within the frame, including margins, illustration, and text area. Do not crop or cut off any part of the page.

Include the **title of the selected fable** prominently and clearly within the page layout, such as at the top of the page or in a decorative storybook header. The title must be fully visible and immediately identifiable to the viewer.

Include the moral of the fable displayed clearly within the page, such as on a parchment banner, book page caption, or decorative text panel. The moral must be short, legible, and directly related to the scene.

Use a traditional storybook illustration style inspired by classic engraved or painted children’s book art. Keep the composition simple, symbolic, and clearly readable on a small screen.

The subject must be styled, dressed, and posed to clearly match a specific music genre and era inferred from their appearance, expression, clothing, environment, or mood. The visual aesthetic must strongly reflect a historically appropriate vinyl-era release year. For example:
• 1960s–70s Rock → analog grain, warm tones, natural light, leather or denim
• 1970s Disco → glossy photography, bold colors, dramatic poses
• 1980s Pop → neon accents, airbrushed look, studio lighting
• 1990s Grunge / Hip-hop → gritty texture, muted colors, urban realism
• 1950s–60s Jazz → monochrome or sepia, elegant composition
• Punk → raw, DIY photocopy look

If the genre is unclear, choose the most fitting genre and era based on the subject’s vibe and surroundings.

Design the image as a complete, square vinyl record cover. The subject must be clearly identifiable as the singer or band front-person, fully integrated into the composition — not pasted in. Lighting, color grading, and framing must feel intentional and era-accurate.

Add album typography directly onto the cover:
• Artist name (based on the subject or a humorous alias inspired by them)
• Album title (creative and genre-appropriate)
• A clearly visible tracklist arranged in a vinyl-typical layout
• A release year prominently displayed that matches the visual era (e.g., 1977, 1984, 1993)

The track names should collectively tell a loose story or emotional arc inspired by the subject’s appearance, pose, or environment. Titles should feel believable for the chosen genre and decade.

Optionally include era-appropriate vinyl details such as:
• Record label logo
• Catalog number
• Stereo / Mono indicator
• Parental Advisory label (only if appropriate for the genre)

Use authentic vinyl album design conventions: readable period-accurate fonts, balanced spacing, subtle print texture, and slight wear or aging if appropriate.

Create two slightly offset views of the scene representing left-eye and right-eye perspectives. Overlay the left-eye view in red and the right-eye view in cyan/blue, aligning them to produce a convincing stereoscopic depth effect.

Depth should be readable through horizontal parallax: foreground elements should show noticeable red/blue separation, while background elements should align more closely.

Preserve the subject’s recognizability while allowing controlled color channel separation. Avoid excessive ghosting or misalignment that would make the image uncomfortable to view.

Lighting, shading, and form should remain realistic so the depth effect feels natural when viewed through 3D glasses.

Do not include Magic Eye patterns, lenticular effects, or split-frame stereoscopy. The image must be a single combined anaglyph composition.

Design the image as a FULL, front-facing board game box, completely visible within the frame with no cropping. Show the box edges, title banner, age range, player count, and bottom information strip so it clearly reads as a real retail board game.

Select the specific game style automatically based on the subject’s appearance, mood, or environment:
• Formal, confident, or businesslike → Monopoly-style
• Cheerful, family-friendly, playful → Life-style
• Childlike, whimsical, or silly → Chutes & Ladders or Candy Land-style
• Chaotic or mischievous → Sorry! or Trouble-style

Illustrate the subject in the exaggerated, cheerful illustration style typical of classic board game box art — expressive pose, simplified features, bright saturated colors, and bold outlines. The subject should feel like part of the original game universe, not a modern photo pasted onto a box.

Create a humorous game title or subtitle inspired by the subject, written in large, bold, vintage-style typography that closely resembles classic board game branding without copying exact logos.

Include playful, absurd supporting details such as:
• fake player count and age range
• a ridiculous but family-friendly game objective
• small icon badges or bursts ("Family Favorite!", "New Edition!", "Now With More Drama!")

The head must be fully **toy-like**, made of smooth, glossy plastic with subtle reflections and soft highlights — it should **look like a manufactured bobblehead head**, not a human head. Enlarge the head relative to the body in true bobblehead style, with slightly exaggerated cartoonish features while keeping the subject recognizable. Simplify details for a playful, toy-like appearance.

Render the body smaller, proportionally correct for a bobblehead, with a plastic finish and soft shadows to make it look tangible. Place the bobblehead on a small pedestal, fully visible in the frame.

Generate the honorary title dynamically using humorous flavor text derived from the subject’s traits, pose, expression, clothing, or environment. For example, 'Supreme Caffeine Conqueror' for someone holding a coffee cup, or 'Master of Stillness' for someone sitting cross-legged. Keep the title bold, funny, and absurd.

Ensure the full bobblehead and pedestal are visible, fully contained in the frame, and clearly readable on small screens.

Generate the book’s title and subtitle using humorous flavor text inspired by the subject’s appearance, posture, expression, clothing, or environment. Examples:
• "How I Almost Had It Together"
• "Leadership, Luck, and Lowered Expectations"
• "The Art of Trying"

Use professional book-cover typography and composition appropriate to the genre (self-help, memoir, motivational, or absurd nonfiction). Optionally include fake bestseller badges, review blurbs, or award seals for added humor.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the book’s title, subtitle, or genre.

Include detailed makeup, wigs, and accessories specific to that production's aesthetic.

Place the subject on stage within an iconic scene from that musical, surrounded by other cast members in full costume performing alongside them. Include recognizable set pieces, props, and staging elements from that specific show - grand staircases, chandeliers, barricades, urban fire escapes, Pride Rock, etc.

Stage lighting should be dramatic theatrical lighting with colored gels, spotlights, dramatic shadows, and that distinctive Broadway stage illumination. Capture the energy of live performance with dynamic poses mid-song or mid-choreography.

The subject should be frozen in a performance moment - singing with emotion, dancing with ensemble, delivering dramatic dialogue, or in an iconic pose from that show. Expression should convey the theatrical emotion and energy of Broadway performance.

Include production value details: orchestra pit visible at stage edge, audience barely visible in darkness beyond footlights, theater architecture, or the massive scale of Broadway set design.

Costume the subject in glamorous 1930s-1940s musical attire: sequined or beaded costume, feathers, flowing fabrics, art deco-inspired design elements, ornate headdress, or elegant formal wear. Chorus dancers should wear matching elaborate costumes creating visual patterns.

Setting should feature Berkeley's signature elements: glossy black reflective floors creating mirror effects, massive art deco sets with geometric staircases, enormous revolving platforms, dramatic columns, or abstract modernist backdrops. Include his famous overhead 'kaleidoscope' camera angle showing the full geometric pattern of dancers.

Lighting should be dramatic 1930s Hollywood style - strong key lights creating glamorous shadows, sparkle effects on sequins and reflective surfaces, high contrast black and white or early Technicolor look with saturated colors.

Choreography frozen mid-movement: synchronized dancers in identical poses creating living geometry, the subject at the center or focal point of the formation, arms and legs positioned to create patterns, possibly using props like fans, hoops, or ribbons arranged symmetrically.

If there are TWO subjects in the image: Have one subject carrying the other on their shoulders. Choose based on context, size, or humor - the carrier should look strained, proud, or playfully struggling while the person being carried shows excitement, triumph, or awkward balance.

If there is only ONE subject in the image: A famous person (specified via master prompt, or choose an appropriate celebrity if none specified) will either carry the subject on their shoulders OR the subject will carry the famous person. The interaction should feel natural and humorous.

Both people should have realistic expressions: the carrier might show effort, determination, or playful annoyance; the person on shoulders might show joy, victory, fear of falling, or awkward balance with arms outstretched.

Preserve recognizable facial features and body proportions for all people. The physical interaction must look believable - proper hand placement on legs/thighs, realistic weight distribution, natural body positioning.

Overlay a fake phone UI including:
• a fake clock and date
• silly or themed app icons inspired by the subject’s traits (e.g., "Fart Tracker", "Overthinking", "Drama Meter", "Nap Mode")
• fake battery, Wi-Fi, and signal indicators with humorous labels

Add subtle cracked-glass lines across the screen — fine hairline fractures, small chips, or spiderweb cracks — so it looks like a phone with a lightly damaged display. The cracks should sit on top of the image like real broken glass, but must not block the subject’s face or important UI text.

Design the interface so it feels like a real smartphone screen but with absurd, playful details. Icons should be large, readable, and placed naturally like a real phone home screen.

Leave the top and bottom areas clear enough that the subject’s face or main features are not blocked by UI elements.

If the subject is MALE: Transform them into either Quico or El Chavo del Ocho. Preserve the subject's recognizable facial features while adapting their appearance to match the character's iconic look - period-appropriate clothing from the 1970s Mexican sitcom, characteristic hairstyle, and the comedic expression associated with the character. El Chavo wears his iconic barrel-striped shirt and cap, while Quico wears his sailor suit or formal attire.

If the subject is FEMALE: Transform them into La Chilindrina. Preserve recognizable facial features while adapting to her iconic appearance - including her signature freckles, pigtails with bows, colorful patterned dress, and thick-framed glasses. Capture her mischievous, playful expression.

The setting should reflect the show's environment: the vecindad (neighborhood courtyard), with its characteristic architecture, stairs, doorways, and the nostalgic 1970s Mexican aesthetic. Include warm, slightly vintage color tones and lighting that matches the show's classic filmed appearance.

The transformation should be photorealistic but capture the comedic, innocent, and nostalgic spirit of the beloved show.

The subject's facial features, expressions, and personality should be adapted into EACH of the six different chess piece types: King, Queen, Rook (2), Knight (2), Bishop (2), and Pawn (8). Each piece should be a miniature sculptural version of the subject, maintaining recognizable identity while adapted to the specific piece's form and role.

Design variations for each piece type:

- KNIGHTS: Subject with horse-themed elements, dynamic action poses
- ROOKS: Subject as tower/castle form, strong geometric base
- PAWNS: Subject in simplified form, smallest and most numerous

All pieces should follow classic Staunton chess piece proportions but personalized with the subject's features, clothing details, or characteristics. Each piece should be clearly identifiable as both the subject AND the chess piece type.

Arrange all 16 pieces (1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns) in proper starting chess positions on a realistic wooden or marble chessboard. Include opposing traditional chess pieces on the other side for context and scale.

Lighting should be dramatic and strategic, casting shadows that emphasize the three-dimensional sculptural quality of each piece. Use proper perspective showing the full board setup.

The subject should still be clearly identifiable, but their skin, hair, and clothing should appear sculpted from cheese rather than flesh or fabric. Objects should retain their original shapes but be unmistakably made of cheese.

Avoid cartoon flatness — cheese should look tactile, slightly glossy or matte depending on type, with realistic imperfections. Use playful lighting to emphasize texture.

• Party or outdoor gathering → Budweiser
• Family or wholesome setting → classic Coca-Cola or cereal ads

Place the subject directly INTO the commercial as if they are the main actor or spokesperson, fully integrated into the scene rather than pasted on. Adapt wardrobe, pose, expression, and lighting so the subject naturally belongs in the advertisement.

Recreate the commercial’s iconic visual language: era-appropriate color grading, film grain, lighting style, set design, camera framing, and product placement. Use a cinematic still-frame composition that feels like a paused moment from a TV ad.

Include a famous, recognizable tagline from the chosen commercial displayed clearly within the scene (on-screen text, signage, packaging, or lower-third caption). The tagline must be fully visible, legible, and feel naturally embedded in the ad design.

If a real brand logo or product appears in the original image or is provided via external master prompt, prioritize selecting that brand’s commercial.

Ensure the full frame is visible with no cropping of the subject, product, or tagline. When a brand is selected, prioritize its most iconic and culturally recognizable catchphrase from classic television commercials (e.g., Wendy’s “Where’s the Beef?”, Budweiser “Whassup!”, Coca-Cola “I’d Like to Buy the World a Coke”), and display it prominently. The scene should feel like a nostalgic parody or affectionate homage to the original commercial, not a modern advertisement or exact recreation.

The **overall cloud shape must follow the subject’s silhouette, posture, and proportions**. The subject’s outline governs the form.

Determine the cloud **type** as follows:
• If the subject is animate (person or animal), select the cloud type based on the subject’s apparent emotion:
  – Happy or playful → **Cumulus** (bright, puffy, well-defined)
  – Sad, tired, or withdrawn → **Nimbostratus** (heavy, low, rain-filled)

  – Calm or neutral → **Stratus** (smooth, layered, subdued)
• If the subject is inanimate, use **Altocumulus** clouds with a neutral, evenly spaced texture.

Use cloud density, lighting, internal shadow, and volume to imply facial features, limbs, and expression without outlines or solid edges.

• **Employee Name:** Generate a humorous but plausible name based on the subject’s appearance, expression, or clothing (unless overridden by external master prompt).
• **Job Title:** Create a funny or exaggerated job title inspired by the subject’s visible traits or environment (e.g., "Senior Snack Analyst," "Head of Vibes," "Chief Button Presser").
• **Employee ID Number:** Use a fictional numeric or alphanumeric code.
• **Department:** Optional, humorous department name derived from context.

Include a **company name and logo**:
• If a real company logo or branding is visible in the image, adapt the logo.
• If a company name or logo is provided via external master prompt, use that name and create a believable logo mark to match.

Add small realistic badge elements such as barcodes, QR codes, issue dates, expiration dates, or security stripes. Text should look official but contain subtle humor when read closely.

Ensure the badge feels professionally designed yet gently ridiculous. Avoid overt meme styling. The final image should feel like a real corporate badge that someone accidentally made funny, and it must be clearly readable on a small screen.`},{name:"CONNECT THE DOTS",category:["PUZZLE","ACTIVITY","LINE ART"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a classic printable connect-the-dots puzzle. Reduce the image to a clean line-art outline that captures the essential shape and silhouette of the subject while removing unnecessary detail.

Place numbered dots along the outline and key interior contours in a **logical sequential order starting with number 1**, so that connecting the dots in order will clearly reveal the subject. Dots should be large, evenly spaced, and easy to follow.

Show very minimal lines or connecting guides—only enough to hint at the outline if necessary, but primarily rely on the numbered dots. Avoid background details, shading, or other guides. Use high-contrast dots suitable for printing. Do not include text, instructions, or labels. The final image should resemble a traditional connect-the-dots puzzle where the user draws all connecting lines by hand, always beginning with dot 1.`},{name:"CONSPIRACY WALL",category:["HUMOR","MYSTERY","DOCUMENT","ABSURD"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into the center of a chaotic conspiracy investigation wall.

Place the subject’s photo (or multiple cropped versions of them) pinned to a corkboard, surrounded by printed photos, scribbled notes, newspaper clippings, diagrams, and red string connecting everything.

The conspiracy theme should be automatically invented based on the subject’s appearance, environment, or actions — OR be influenced by external master prompt text if provided (for example: "pizza", "aliens", "taxes", "office drama", "time travel", etc.).

Use absurd, humorous conspiracy logic. Examples:
• 'Always near the coffee machine'
• 'Was present every time the printer jammed'
• 'Knows too much about Tuesdays'
• 'Connected to the dog somehow'

Do not include readable real-world sensitive data. All notes should be fictional, funny, and harmless.

Include red string connecting photos, arrows, circles, and question marks drawn in marker. The board should feel cluttered, frantic, and obsessed.

Ensure the entire corkboard is fully visible in the frame. The final image should look like a deranged investigator has been tracking the subject for years.`},{name:"CONSTELLATION",category:["SPACE","STARS","NIGHT SKY"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into a living constellation in the night sky. Reimagine the subject’s silhouette, facial features, and pose as a pattern of glowing stars connected by faint celestial lines, while keeping their identity recognizable. Surround the subject with a deep, cosmic backdrop filled with nebulae, subtle stardust, and distant galaxies. Use soft glows, luminous highlights, and gentle gradients to create a magical, astronomical aesthetic. The subject should appear formed entirely from stars and light, as if they are part of the universe itself, rendered with crisp detail and awe-inspiring atmosphere."},{name:"CONSTRUCTIVISM",category:["ART","DESIGN","SOVIET","GEOMETRIC"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into Constructivism style art. Bold geometry, diagonal compositions, limited color palettes, and graphic poster-like structure."},{name:"COPY MACHINE COPY",category:["OFFICE","RETRO","HUMOR","DEGRADED"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into an authentic photocopier copy made by pressing the subject directly against the copier glass.

The final image must resemble a single sheet of copier paper viewed flat and fully visible within the frame, including paper edges and margins. Do not crop the page.

The subject should appear distorted from being pressed against the glass: flattened features, slightly squashed face or objects, widened nose, compressed cheeks, stretched hands or fingers, and uneven contact areas. The distortion should feel physical and silly, not warped digitally.

Apply classic photocopier artifacts: harsh black-and-white or muddy grayscale tones, blown highlights, crushed shadows, toner speckling, faint streaks, edge shadows from the copier lid, uneven exposure, and slight skew or rotation. Include faint dust marks or smudges typical of a well-used office copier.

Lighting should feel internal to the copier — flat, overexposed, and directionless — not like studio lighting. The background should be blank or show subtle shadows from the copier lid.

Optionally include a small copier interface imprint or margin text such as page numbers, contrast indicators, or misaligned registration marks, rendered faintly and partially cut off.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the subject’s pose (e.g., face, hands, object pressed to glass) or tone of humor. The result should feel unmistakably like a dumb, impulsive office photocopy — absurd, tactile, and clearly readable on a small screen.`},{name:"COURTROOM SKETCH",category:["HUMOR","DOCUMENT","SKETCH","CRIME"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a courtroom sketch drawn by a courtroom artist.

Render the subject in a loose, expressive pencil or charcoal style on off-white paper, with exaggerated but recognizable facial features, messy line work, and rough shading. The drawing should look like it was made quickly while observing the subject live in court.

Place the subject seated at a courtroom table or in the witness stand, with simplified figures of a judge, lawyers, or jury in the background.

Add subtle emotion based on the subject’s expression or posture — nervous, confused, smug, bored, or guilty — even if they are innocent.

Include a small caption area or handwritten label such as "The Defendant" or "Key Witness" (do not include real names unless provided via master prompt).

The entire sketch page should be fully visible within the frame, including paper edges. The final image should feel like a real courtroom artist drawing from a televised trial.`},{name:"CUBAN ART STYLE",category:["ART","PAINTING","MODERN"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a Cuban art style illustration inspired by Cuban Modernism and Afro-Cuban visual traditions. Use bold tropical colors, strong outlines, flattened perspective, and expressive shapes.

Incorporate cultural rhythms through movement, pattern, and color. The subject should feel integrated into a warm, vibrant Cuban environment, with subtle influences of Afro-Cuban symbolism, music, and everyday life.

The final image should feel expressive, soulful, colorful, and culturally rich rather than realistic or photographic.`},{name:"CUBISM",category:["ART","PAINTING","MODERN","GEOMETRIC"],message:"Take a picture in the style of Cubist Art. Break objects into geometric forms and reassemble them from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, challenging traditional perspective and depth to emphasize the two-dimensional canvas."},{name:"CYBERPUNK",category:["SCI FI","NEON","FUTURISTIC"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into a cyberpunk scene.

Combine cut-and-paste textures, absurd juxtapositions, and fragmented composition. Subject recognizable within surreal elements."},{name:"DALÍ",category:["ART","SURREAL","ARTIST"],message:"Take a picture and transform it into a painting of a surreal scene inspired by Salvador Dalí. Preserve the subject’s photographic realism while introducing dreamlike distortions, warped perspectives, melting forms, or impossible juxtapositions. Lighting should feel dramatic and hyper-real. The final image should feel uncanny, symbolic, and visually unsettling while still rooted in the original photo."},{name:"DANCING WITH THE STARS",category:["HUMOR","TV","ENTERTAINMENT","POP CULTURE"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a scene from a glamorous ballroom dance competition show inspired by 'Dancing with the Stars.'

Dress the subject in an over-the-top, flashy dance costume — sequins, rhinestones, dramatic colors, exaggerated styling — appropriate for professional ballroom dancing.

Pose the subject mid-dance in a way that clearly suggests they do NOT know how to dance: awkward posture, stiff limbs, off-balance stance, mistimed spin, or exaggerated confusion. The humor should come from the contrast between the elegant setting and the subject’s obvious lack of dance skill.

Place the subject on a polished ballroom stage with dramatic lighting, spotlight beams, glossy floors, and a cheering audience in the background. The environment should feel high-budget and televised.

Optionally include subtle show elements like judges’ tables, score paddles, or stage graphics — without copying logos.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the dance style, outfit theme, or tone (romantic, intense, chaotic, overly dramatic).

Ensure the full subject, costume, and stage are visible and clearly readable on a small screen. The final image should feel like a frozen TV broadcast moment — glamorous, ridiculous, and instantly funny.`},{name:"DATING PROFILE",category:["HUMOR","SOCIAL MEDIA","PROFILE","MASTER PROMPT"],message:"Take a picture and create a dating profile–style image of the subject.

Ensure all text is clearly readable within the image. Render the final result with flattering lighting, clear focus, photorealistic detail, and a lively, engaging composition."},{name:"DEEP THOUGHTS BY JACK HANDEY",category:["HUMOR","ABSURD"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a minimalist, deadpan inspirational-style image inspired by 'Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey.' The subject should appear calm, neutral, or unintentionally serious, regardless of how absurd the final message is.

Select ONE original 'Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey' quote and present it as the affirmation text. The humor should come from the contrast between the sincere visual tone and the unexpectedly absurd or philosophical text.

Compose the image simply and cleanly: the subject centered or thoughtfully framed, with the quote displayed clearly beneath or overlaid in an understated font. Do not explain the joke. Do not exaggerate expressions. Let the humor remain dry and subtle.

Ensure the entire image and text are fully visible and easily readable on a small screen. The final result should feel like a serious inspirational poster that accidentally delivers an absurd, ironic truth.`},{name:"DESOMETRIC ART",category:["ART"],message:"Take a picture in the style of desometric art."},{name:"DICTIONARY",category:["TEXT","REFERENCE","DEFINITION"],message:"Take a picture and transform it into a dictionary-style entry. Include a small, clearly visible photograph of the subject placed beside or beneath the definition, similar to a modern illustrated dictionary.

The final image must show the **entire bill fully visible** within the frame, flat and uncropped, with realistic proportions, borders, and margins of a classic U.S.-style dollar bill. Do not zoom in or cut off edges.

Render the subject’s face as an engraved-style portrait suitable for currency printing. Preserve recognizable facial structure and expression, but translate it into fine linework, cross-hatching, and stippling so it looks printed, not photographic. The portrait should feel integrated into the bill design, not pasted on.

Design the bill with traditional currency elements:
• Ornamental borders and scrollwork
• Decorative frames and rosettes
• Serial numbers (fictional)
• Treasury-style seals (parody, non-official)
• Micro-pattern textures and guilloché lines

Replace all real-world identifiers with humorous equivalents:
• Use a fictional denomination (e.g., "$1 DOLLAR BOB," "$3 DOLLAR BOB," "$100 DOLLAR BOB")
• Replace national mottos with absurd or playful phrases inspired by the subject’s traits or posture
• Include a humorous title beneath the portrait instead of a real name (e.g., "In Snacks We Trust," "Certified Snack Authority")

Color palette should resemble classic green-and-black currency ink on aged paper. Add subtle wear such as folds, creases, ink bleed, or slight yellowing for realism.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the denomination, slogan, title, or tone of the bill.

All text, seals, and symbols must be clearly fictional and parody-based.

Moody, artistic tone."},{name:"DRAG ME",category:["HUMOR","TRANSFORMATION","GLAMOUR"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a fabulous, over-the-top drag queen persona.

Preserve the subject's recognizable facial structure and features while applying full drag transformation: dramatic contouring, bold eye makeup with exaggerated lashes and colorful eyeshadow, sculpted cheekbones, overdrawn lips with glossy or matte finish, and flawlessly blended foundation.

Add a show-stopping drag wig: big hair with volume, vibrant colors, styled with curls, waves, or dramatic height. The wig should be theatrical and attention-grabbing.

Dress the subject in glamorous drag attire: sequined gowns, feather boas, rhinestone-covered garments, platform heels, dramatic jewelry, or avant-garde fashion pieces. The outfit should be bold, confident, and unapologetically fabulous.

Pose and expression should exude confidence, sass, and star power - fierce, playful, or elegantly commanding.

Lighting should be stage-quality with a touch of theatrical glamour. Background can be a runway, stage, club setting, or dramatic backdrop with spotlights.

The final image must be photorealistic, celebrating drag artistry with respect, humor, and fabulous energy. Make it fierce, make it fun, make it unforgettable.`},{name:"DREAM LOGIC",category:["SURREAL","ABSTRACT","DREAMY"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image using dream logic.

Render the subject using continuous, thin, single-line strokes characteristic of Etch A Sketch drawings. Use simple outlines and minimal detail while preserving the subject’s recognizable shape and expression. The drawing should appear slightly imperfect, with subtle line wobble and overlaps consistent with manual knob control.

Ensure the background is the Etch A Sketch screen texture, and keep the overall composition clean and centered. Do not add text or extra graphics.

The image should look like a staged holiday portrait taken with an on-camera flash: flat lighting, slight red-eye, soft focus, mild film grain, and dated color tones. The setting should feel like a living room or photo studio decorated for the chosen holiday.

Include classic, slightly tacky holiday decorations appropriate to the selected holiday. Decorations should feel excessive, mismatched, or unevenly arranged (e.g., too many balloons, awkward banners, cheap props, cluttered tables, or off-theme color combinations).

Dress all subjects in era-appropriate holiday clothing that clashes or feels uncomfortable. Examples include ugly sweaters, oversized cardigans, patterned vests, turtlenecks, stiff dresses, themed novelty outfits, or poorly coordinated formalwear. Hairstyles should be dated and awkward: big teased hair, perms, mullets, bowl cuts, feathered bangs, or obvious hairspray volume.

Subject logic:
• If there is ONE subject, surround them with added family members (parents, siblings, or relatives) who look mismatched or emotionally disconnected.
• If there are MULTIPLE subjects, present them as a family group standing or sitting closely together.

Body language should feel tense or unnatural: forced smiles, blank stares, crossed arms, stiff posture, uneven spacing, or someone clearly looking away from the camera. Not everyone should appear happy at the same time.

Optionally include a dated holiday banner, sign, or photo caption naming the holiday and year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a plausible holiday label and year).

Ensure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed holiday portrait.

The final image must look like a full sheet of faxed paper viewed flat and fully visible within the frame, including margins, header, and body. Do not crop the page.

Apply classic fax artifacts: harsh black-and-white contrast, dithering, streaking scan lines, slight skew, uneven toner density, paper curl shadows, compression noise, and faint horizontal banding. The subject should appear embedded within the faxed image area and degraded but still identifiable.

At the top of the page, include a standard fax cover header with the following sections, all rendered in simple monospace or office-style fonts and visibly degraded:

• **From (Sender):** A humorous sender name, company, fax number, and phone number inspired by the subject’s appearance, clothing, posture, or environment (e.g., "Gary from Accounting," "Dept. of Snacks," "Fax: 555-0199").
• **To (Recipient):** A humorous recipient name, organization, and fax number, derived from scene context or absurd office logic.
• **Date:** A plausible transmission date (can be generic or stylized).
• **Subject / Re:** A short, funny description of the fax contents based on the subject or scene (e.g., "Urgent: Hat Situation," "Re: Chair Malfunction Update").
• **Pages:** Include a page count such as "1 of 1".

Below the header, include a **Confidentiality Notice** in small text, written humorously but styled like a real legal disclaimer (e.g., warning unintended recipients to destroy the fax immediately or consult a supervisor named something absurd).

All names, numbers, and text must be fictional, non-sensitive, and clearly comedic. If external master prompt text is provided, use it to override or guide sender, recipient, subject line, or tone.

Style characteristics: Ultra-bright saturated colors with bold black outlines, flat color fills with minimal shading, playful exaggerated proportions and perspectives. The aesthetic should resemble colorful painted cardstock or screen-printed paper sheets stacked at different heights, rendered with realistic miniature scale and physical dimensionality.

Layering structure: Divide the scene into at least 5-7 distinct depth levels with strong cast shadows between each layer emphasizing the sculptural three-dimensional quality.

CRITICAL - PACK THE SCENE WITH MINIATURES: Fill every inch of the composition with abundant miniature elements densely arranged: tiny buildings with architectural details, miniature cars and vehicles, small-scale people figures, street signs, storefronts, windows, decorative patterns, architectural ornaments, repeating shapes, whimsical embellishments, busy textures, trees, street lamps, and countless playful visual elements. The scene should feel like a bustling miniature cityscape or metropolitan diorama with an overwhelming joyful abundance of tiny detailed objects all bunched together. No empty space - every area should be filled with miniature sculptural elements.

CRITICAL - SUBJECT SCALE: Transform the subject into a three-dimensional miniature figure within this densely packed layered diorama at the EXACT SAME SMALL SCALE as all other miniature elements. The subject must be proportionally sized to match the tiny buildings, miniature cars, and small people figures surrounding them - NOT larger or more prominent. If buildings are 2-3 inches tall in the miniature scene, the subject figure should be appropriately scaled (roughly 1 inch or smaller if representing a person). The subject should appear as ONE SMALL ELEMENT among many in the busy cityscape, not dominating the composition. They must have physical depth and dimension like a detailed figurine, integrated naturally among all other miniatures at consistent scale.

The final result should look like a physical framed miniature diorama or shadow box photographed straight-on, showcasing vibrant metropolitan energy with extreme visual depth, realistic three-dimensional construction, CONSISTENT miniature scale throughout with the subject properly sized to match all surrounding elements, overwhelming joyful abundance of densely packed tiny details, and clear dimensional separation between layers.

The photograph should appear as a documented observation supporting the entry."},{name:"FIFTH BEATLE",category:["MUSIC","60S","ROCK","ICONIC","BRITISH"],message:`Take a picture and insert the subject as the fifth member of The Beatles in one of their iconic photographs. Randomly select from these famous scenes:

ABBEY ROAD CROSSING: Place the subject walking in line with the four Beatles across the zebra crossing on Abbey Road. The subject should be dressed in period-appropriate 1969 clothing (suit, casual wear, or barefoot like one member). Match the walking stride and positioning. Background shows the tree-lined London street.

COLORFUL MILITARY COSTUMES: Place the subject alongside the band wearing vibrant, elaborate military-inspired costume from 1967. Include ornate jacket with decorative elements, bright colors (pink, yellow, orange, blue), psychedelic era styling. Subject should be posed with the group in formal portrait arrangement.

BEACH SCENE: Insert the subject playing in the ocean waves with the band at a beach. Everyone should be in 1964 swimwear or casual beach clothes, splashing in water, showing youthful energy and joy. Bright sunny beach setting.

EARLY CLUB PERFORMANCE: Place the subject on stage with the band in a small underground club setting. Everyone wearing matching suits with narrow ties, distinctive 1960s hairstyles (mop-top or similar period style). Instruments visible, intimate venue with brick walls and low ceiling. Black and white or slightly muted color photography.

AIRPORT ARRIVAL: Insert the subject descending airplane stairs or in terminal with the band, surrounded by crowds of fans and press photographers. Everyone wearing sharp matching suits, waving to camera. 1960s airport setting with vintage aircraft visible. Capture the excitement and chaos of fan mania.

For all scenarios:

- Preserve subject's recognizable facial features while adapting them to 1960s style
- Integrate subject naturally as if they were always part of the group
- Capture the specific mood and energy of that particular photograph
- Use authentic 1960s photography techniques, lighting, and composition

The final image should look like an actual vintage photograph from the 1960s with the subject seamlessly integrated as a genuine fifth member of the band, matching the iconic style and feeling of the original scene.`},{name:"FIGHT CLUB",category:["HUMOR","INJURY","ACTION","TOUGH"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject to look like they've just been in a serious physical fight, with realistic battle damage and injuries.

Add visible injuries: a swollen black eye with dark purple bruising, a bloody nose with blood dripping or smeared on face, swollen or split lip, cuts and scrapes on face, reddened areas from impacts.

Clothing should be disheveled, torn, or stained with blood spots. Hair should be messy and out of place from the struggle.

The subject's expression should show exhaustion, defiance, toughness, or the aftermath of adrenaline - perhaps breathing heavily, grimacing, or showing a tough determined look despite the damage.

Optional context: Background could suggest where the fight occurred (alley, gym, street, parking lot), possibly with other visual clues of the altercation.

Keep all injuries photorealistic as if this is an actual photograph taken immediately after a fight. The damage should look fresh and recent with appropriate coloring for bruises (dark purple, red, swelling) and blood (realistic red, properly placed).

Preserve the subject's recognizable facial features while adding realistic fight injuries and tough, battle-worn appearance. The mood can be serious or darkly humorous depending on the subject's expression.`},{name:"FILM NOIR",category:["MOVIES","BLACK AND WHITE","VINTAGE","DRAMATIC"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into classic film noir style.

Add realistic grime such as dirt, mud, stains, splashes, smears, or dried mess. If appropriate, include cartoonishly unpleasant elements like poop, sludge, or foul residue applied to the object’s surface without obscuring it completely.

Ensure the filth follows the object’s contours, texture, and lighting so it looks physically present rather than overlaid. The result should be visually obvious, humorous or shocking, and immediately readable on a small screen.`},{name:"FIND ME",category:["ILLUSION","HIDDEN","CAMOUFLAGE"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image so the subject is fully visible yet intentionally hidden through perfect visual camouflage. The subject’s clothing, colors, textures, and patterns must precisely match and continue the surrounding environment, making the subject difficult to distinguish at first glance. Do not remove or blur the subject — instead, conceal them through seamless pattern alignment, color continuity, and texture matching. The subject must remain physically present with accurate scale, lighting, shadows, and depth, so they clearly exist once noticed. Avoid outlines, highlights, or obvious separation; the concealment should feel deliberate, intelligent, and visually satisfying when discovered."},{name:"FORCED PERSPECTIVE",category:["ILLUSION","PHOTOGRAPHY","TRICK"],message:"Take a picture and place the subject into a scene that uses forced perspective to create a clever visual illusion. The subject should appear to interact with large or distant objects using scale tricks (for example: pinching the sun, holding the moon, pushing a skyscraper, balancing a mountain on their palm).

The subject should be presented as a dramatic, mysterious attraction with exaggerated features, theatrical posing, and bold stage lighting.

Design the image like an old carnival poster, with ornate borders, hand-painted lettering, and weathered paper texture.

Include a sensational headline and dramatic tagline describing the subject as a strange or amazing curiosity, using humorous or absurd flavor text.

Preserve body posture, clothing, lighting direction, skin tone consistency, and camera perspective. Maintain natural neck alignment and correct scale so each swapped head fits the new body believably.

If exactly one subject is detected, perform an inverse face transformation by subtly mirroring or inverting the subject’s facial features while preserving overall realism, expression, and identity. The result should feel intentionally uncanny but not distorted.

If no subjects are detected, return the original image unchanged. The final image should be visually coherent and readable on small screens.`},{name:"FRIDGE ART",category:["ART","HUMOR","NAIVE","CHILD LIKE"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a child’s crayon drawing displayed on a refrigerator.

Render the subject as a deliberately crude crayon drawing with uneven proportions, simple shapes, wobbly outlines, and flat scribbled coloring. Facial features and limbs should be exaggerated or misaligned in a childlike way while still being loosely recognizable.

Use a plain white or lightly stained paper background with visible crayon texture and pressure marks. Add misspelled handwritten text such as a name, age, or caption written in childlike lettering.

Attach the drawing to a refrigerator using colorful magnets. Show part of the fridge surface, smudges, and nearby papers or photos.

Ensure the entire drawing and fridge context are fully visible.

The subject should lie flush on the frosting surface — fully integrated — but the frosting itself should have realistic texture: piped swirls, slight ridges, creaminess, and subtle shadows so it clearly looks like real icing, not a topper.

Render the subject simply, preserving only the most recognizable facial features, posture, or silhouette. Avoid overly detailed or three-dimensional features; the design should be believable as hand-piped or painted frosting.

Include realistic cake decorations such as frosting borders, small swirls, sprinkles, or minor fondant accents. If no external message is provided via master prompt, automatically add playful flavor text based on the subject: e.g., 'Happy 1st Birthday!' if the subject appears young, or 'Happy Retirement!' if the subject appears older.

If an external message is provided, append it naturally using piping-style lettering around the subject. Ensure the full cake top and subject are fully visible in the frame. Use soft, realistic lighting and perspective so the subject and frosting appear tactile and integrated. The final image should feel festive, humorous, and clearly readable on small screens, while lying flat on the cake surface.`},{name:"FROZEN IN ICE",category:["COLD","ICE","PRESERVED"],message:"Take a picture and make it appear as if the subject is frozen inside a clear block of ice.

Render the subject in the same visual style as Futurama characters: clean bold outlines, flat cel shading, simplified geometric facial features, exaggerated eyes, smooth rounded head shapes, and bright saturated colors. Preserve the subject’s recognizability while fully adapting them into the cartoon style.

Place the subject INTO an iconic Futurama environment and scene, selected based on context or randomly, such as:
• inside the Planet Express building or conference room
• standing with Fry, Leela, and Bender in the Planet Express crew lineup
• walking through New New York with futuristic buildings and flying cars
• inside MomCorp, the Head Museum, or a sci-fi lab
• in a space scene with Futurama characters reacting to the subject

Existing Futurama characters may appear in the scene as supporting characters, background figures, or interaction partners, drawn accurately in their recognizable cartoon style. The subject should feel like a guest character naturally written into an episode, not pasted on top.

Adapt the subject’s clothing into Futurama-appropriate outfits — delivery uniforms, sci-fi jumpsuits, futuristic casual wear, or humorous future attire inspired by their real clothing.

Use simple painted backgrounds, clean animation lighting, and minimal texture consistent with hand-drawn cel animation. Avoid realistic shading or painterly effects.

Convert the subject into true dot-matrix pixel art using a visible grid of circular pixels, limited tonal steps, and strong contrast. Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features and silhouette while adapting them to the constraints of a handheld screen resolution. Simulate real screen characteristics including pixel ghosting, motion blur trails, uneven refresh, slight vertical smearing, faint scan artifacts, and subtle screen noise. Avoid smooth gradients—everything should appear quantized and grid-based. Frame the image strictly as the handheld screen view itself, with a thin dark border suggesting the screen edge. Do not include logos, branding, or copyrighted UI elements. Optional minimal pixel indicators (numbers or icons only) may appear at the edges of the screen.

The mess should be overwhelming and chaotic.

Items can be themed for humor: all garden gnomes, excessive craft supplies, thousands of fast food condiment packets, walls of VHS tapes, mountains of beanie babies, or traditional hoarding clutter. Make it densely packed and overwhelming.

The subject's expression should show they see nothing wrong with the situation - casual, defensive, or attached to their items. Clothing can be casual or slightly disheveled.

Determine the subject’s astrological sign based on externally provided input or infer one arbitrarily if none is supplied. Clearly display the astrological sign name and symbol.

Write ONE short horoscope message based on the subject’s visible traits, expression, posture, clothing, or situation. The horoscope must be humorous, blunt, and confidently ridiculous — it should sound specific, obvious, and completely unserious.

Use flavor text to exaggerate mundane or trivial traits (e.g., procrastination, overconfidence, distraction, stubbornness) as if they are unavoidable cosmic truths. Avoid mystical language, poetic ambiguity, or generic fortune-cookie phrasing.

Include a clearly labeled "Lucky Number" that is intentionally useless, impractical, or meaningless (e.g., decimals, extremely large numbers, fractions, timestamps, negative numbers, or oddly specific values). The lucky number must not be applicable to gambling, dates, clocks, or real-world decisions.

Compose the image like a fake astrology card or newspaper horoscope box. Keep the layout clean, bold, and readable on a small screen. Ensure the full card, sign, horoscope text, and lucky number are fully visible.

Do not explain the joke. Do not add disclaimers. Treat the horoscope as completely accurate, no matter how absurd.`},{name:"CLASSIC HORROR FILMS",category:["HUMOR","MOVIE","SCENE","HORROR"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them into a scene from a classic horror film, such as *Friday the 13th*, *Nightmare on Elm Street*, *The Shining*, or *Psycho*.

The subject should be the central figure, reacting to the horror environment or villain in a dramatic or exaggerated way.

Lighting, perspective, and props should match the iconic horror style — dark shadows, eerie lighting, and creepy set pieces.

Optional master prompt text can add humorous twists (e.g., subject holding a comically oversized weapon, screaming dramatically, or unintentionally scaring the villain).

The final image should feel cinematic, instantly recognizable as a classic horror scene, and funny or absurd depending on the subject’s pose or expression.`},{name:"I'M HUNGRY",category:["FOOD","TRANSFORMATION","MASTER PROMPT"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a figure entirely made out of real, non-candy food items (vegetables, fruits, grains, bread, pasta, cheese, etc.). Preserve recognizable features, proportions, and posture while rendering them in edible textures — e.g., eyes made of olives, hair as leafy greens, clothing patterns from colorful produce. Avoid candy or chocolate elements.

Place the food figure in a simple, neutral background such as a kitchen counter, plate, or wooden surface, with natural lighting and subtle shadows to make it appear tangible and realistic. Ensure the entire subject is fully visible.

Add playful flavor text to the scene automatically based on the subject, like 'Dinner is served!' or 'Eat your vegetables!' or allow the user to append a custom message via master prompt.

The final image should feel whimsical, absurd, humorous, and clearly readable on small screens, emphasizing the creativity of using ordinary food items to replicate the subject.`},{name:"I'M WITH STOOPID",category:["HUMOR","TEXT","SHIRT"],message:`Take a picture and transform it so one subject appears to be wearing an 'I'm with Stoopid' t-shirt that looks physically printed on the fabric, not digitally overlaid. The shirt should include natural folds, fabric texture, slight ink distortion, and perspective warping so the design follows the body realistically.

If only one subject is detected, display the text 'I'm with Stoopid' with a single large arrow pointing upward toward the wearer’s own head.

If two or more subjects are detected, place the shirt on the primary subject and display the text 'I'm with Stoopid' with one or more arrows pointing sideways or diagonally toward the other visible subjects. Arrows should clearly indicate the other subjects without overlapping faces.

Ensure the text and arrows remain bold, high-contrast, and legible on small screens while maintaining a believable printed-shirt appearance. Preserve lighting consistency, fabric shading, and natural wrinkles so the shirt feels worn, not pasted.`},{name:"I AM WITH THE BAND",category:["MUSIC","PERFORMANCE","CELEBRITY","MASTER PROMPT"],message:"Take a picture and place the subject as a member of a famous singer’s band or musical group. Preserve the subject’s facial features, personality, and clothing while transforming them into a musician integrated into the ensemble. The subject should be holding or playing a musical instrument appropriate to the scene (guitar, drums, keyboard, etc.) and positioned naturally among other group members. Capture stage lighting, performance energy, and the dynamic interaction of a live or recorded music setting. Ensure the subject remains clearly identifiable while fully integrated into the famous singer’s group performance."},{name:"ICE SCULPTURE",category:["SCULPTURE","ICE","COLD"],message:"Take a picture and make subject into an ice sculpture.

Place the subject directly inside the literal version of the expression (for example: head in the clouds, walking on thin ice, burning the midnight oil). Preserve realism in lighting and composition while embracing the absurdity of the literal interpretation. The scene should be instantly readable, humorous, and visually clever without requiring any text."},{name:"IF YOU THINK IT'S TRUE, IT'S SNOT",category:["HUMOR","GROSS","EMBARRASSING"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into one of two embarrassing nasal situations - RANDOMLY CHOOSE ONE:

OPTION 1 - VISIBLE BOOGERS: The subject is completely unaware they have visible nasal discharge (boogers) hanging from or under their nose. Add realistic mucus visible at the nostrils - it could be hanging, crusty, or dripping slightly. The subject's expression must show they are completely oblivious - looking normal, happy, confident, or engaged in conversation. They think everything is fine, making the situation more awkward and humorous.

OPTION 2 - NOSE PICKING: The subject is actively picking their nose with their finger inserted into their nostril. They are completely absorbed in the act, unaware they're being photographed. The finger should be realistically positioned in the nose with appropriate hand placement. Their expression should show concentration or absent-minded focus on the task. This could be in a public setting, during a meeting, in a car, or any situation where nose-picking would be particularly inappropriate.

For both options: Include optional context that makes it worse - professional setting (meeting, presentation, date, interview), talking to someone, or what they think is a nice photo opportunity.

Keep lighting and photography photorealistic. The humor comes from either the subject's obliviousness to the visible boogers OR being caught in the act of nose-picking.

Preserve recognizable facial features while adding the unfortunate nasal situation.`},{name:"IKEA INSTRUCTION MANUAL",category:["HUMOR","INSTRUCTIONS","DIAGRAM"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into an illustrated instruction manual page, similar to a flat-pack assembly guide. Depict simplified, diagram-style versions of the subject in multiple steps, showing how the subject is assembled or functions. Use clean line art, minimal colors, arrows, step numbers, icons, and humorous warning symbols inspired by the subject’s personality, clothing, or posture. Avoid text-heavy explanations; rely on visual storytelling and pictograms. Present the final image as a complete instruction manual page with a clean layout and playful, clever tone."},{name:"INFINITY MIRROR",category:["ART","OPTICAL","LIGHT","INSTALLATION","SURREAL"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a real infinity-mirror light sculpture.

The subject must remain clearly recognizable (face, body, or object). Do NOT replace the subject with abstract light.

Convert the interior of the subject into a two-way mirror cavity that creates infinite visual depth. The inside of the subject should look hollow and reflective, like a real infinity mirror, with reflections repeating deeper and deeper inside the subject’s shape.

Outline the subject’s silhouette, facial features, or body shape using thin LED light strips (neon-style). These LEDs form the FRAME of the infinity mirror. The lights must only run along the subject’s edges, eyes, mouth, body outline, or major contours — NOT across the background.

Inside those glowing outlines, the mirror reflections should multiply the LEDs endlessly, creating the illusion of a glowing tunnel extending inward.

The surrounding environment should be dark or neutral so the infinity effect stands out, but the subject must not disappear into the background.

Do NOT render this as a painting, illustration, or glowing person. It must look like a real physical infinity-mirror sculpture or wall installation photographed in a gallery.

The final image should look like a recognizable subject made of light and mirrors, with endless depth visible inside their face or body.`},{name:"INFLATABLE POOL TOY",category:["FUN","INFLATABLE","HUMOR","TOY"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a single, continuous inflatable pool toy. The subject’s entire body, including the head and face, must be made of inflated vinyl material — the subject is the pool float itself, not wearing or sitting in one.

Render the face as part of the inflatable surface with printed or molded features, subtle distortions, and glossy reflections consistent with air-filled vinyl. Include seams, air valves, and slight shape irregularities.

Place the inflatable subject floating in water or resting poolside. Use realistic reflections, highlights, and water interaction. Ensure the entire inflatable is fully visible and readable on a small screen.`},{name:"INFRARED",category:["PHOTOGRAPHY","TECHNICAL","THERMAL"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into infrared photography.

Abstract symmetry, flowing ink forms on paper."},{name:"INTERVENTION",category:["HUMOR","TV","REALITY","DOCUMENTARY"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a scene from the reality show 'Intervention' where family and friends confront someone about a problem.

The subject should be seated, looking shocked, defensive, emotional, or in denial. Surround them with concerned family members and friends sitting in a semicircle, all looking serious and worried. Include an intervention specialist or counselor present.

Setting should be a modest living room or community center room with folding chairs arranged in intervention style. Lighting should match reality TV documentary style - slightly dim, handheld camera aesthetic, authentic and raw.

Optional humorous details: Instead of serious addiction, the intervention could be for ridiculous obsessions like 'collecting too many throw pillows,' 'excessive karaoke,' 'TikTok addiction,' 'spending too much on craft supplies,' or 'won't stop talking about their fantasy football team.'

Include tissues boxes visible, people holding letters they've written, emotional expressions of concern from family members. The subject should look caught off guard, emotional, or stubbornly defensive.

The aesthetic should match reality TV confessional style with that specific documentary lighting and framing. Optional: Include text overlay at bottom like reality shows use - 'Day 1 of Intervention' or subject's name and their 'problem.'

The final image should look like an actual still frame from the Intervention TV show - emotional, raw, documentary style, capturing that specific reality TV aesthetic. Make it photorealistic but the humor comes from either the absurd reason for intervention or the over-the-top dramatic reactions.`},{name:"iPHONE CAMERA",category:["PHOTOGRAPHY","RETRO","SMARTPHONE"],message:"Take a picture and transform it into an early smartphone camera photo.

Flattened perspective, decorative borders, fine line work, intricate patterns, and vivid colors."},{name:"ISOMETRIC",category:["DESIGN","3D","GEOMETRIC","STRUCTURAL"],message:`Take a picture and completely reconstruct the scene using strict isometric projection.

All elements must be viewed from a fixed isometric angle (approximately 30–45 degrees) with no vanishing points, no perspective convergence, and no camera lens distortion. Parallel lines must remain parallel.

Rebuild the scene as simplified geometric forms aligned to an isometric grid. Convert subjects, objects, and environments into clean, block-like or planar shapes while preserving recognizable proportions and silhouettes.

Depth must be represented only through isometric extrusion, vertical offsets, overlap, and stacking — not through blur, bokeh, or atmospheric effects.

Use consistent lighting and shading across all surfaces to reinforce form and depth. Shadows should be crisp, directional, and uniform, matching the isometric angle.

Surface detail should be simplified or removed. Avoid photographic textures, skin pores, fabric weave, or noise. Favor smooth, stylized surfaces suitable for a game map, architectural diagram, or technical illustration.

The final image should resemble a high-quality isometric game environment or design diagram — clean, readable, geometric, and clearly structured.

The subject should be fully integrated into the scene, interacting naturally with the environment and other characters as if they are the main focus.

Costumes, lighting, and props should match the era of the film — 1980s high school or suburban settings, vintage cars, lockers, diners, etc.

Optional flavor text from the master prompt can influence the scene, such as having the subject deliver a famous line, partake in iconic antics, or create a humorous twist.

The final image should be cinematic, instantly recognizable as a John Hughes film, and funny or absurd depending on the subject’s pose or expression.`},{name:"KAHLO",category:["ART","PAINTING","ARTIST","MEXICAN"],message:"Take a picture and transform it into a portrait inspired by Frida Kahlo.

The subject should be the central figure, fully integrated with realistic lighting, wind effects, and perspective from the bow of the ship.

Optional flavor text from the master prompt can influence the subject’s pose, facial expression, or humorous twist (e.g., over-the-top excitement, exaggerated wind-blown hair, or slipping slightly).

The final image should feel like a dramatic cinematic still, instantly recognizable as the famous scene, but humorous and starring the subject as the protagonist.`},{name:"KISS CAM",category:["HUMOR","PHOTO","SITUATIONAL"],message:`Take a picture of one or more subjects and transform it into a humorous 'Kiss Cam' moment at a sporting event.

Render the scene photorealistically as if captured by a live stadium camera. The subjects should have exaggerated expressions of shock, embarrassment, awkwardness, or confusion - not cartoonish.

Include realistic background elements: stadium seating, cheering crowd in soft focus, jumbotron screens, arena lighting, and authentic sporting venue atmosphere.

The awkwardness should feel authentic and relatable: subjects might be leaning away, covering their faces, looking in opposite directions, holding drinks or food awkwardly, or clearly unprepared for the moment.

Optional realistic details: other audience members reacting in the background, stadium signage, team colors and branding, or humorous but believable context clues.

Optional props or signs in the background may add to the humor, e.g., 'Halitosis', 'Not Interested', 'Wrong Partner'.

The final image must look like an actual photograph taken at a real sporting event - authentic lighting, natural skin tones, realistic fabric and textures, and genuine human expressions. The humor comes from the real, relatable awkwardness of the situation, not cartoon exaggeration.`},{name:"KITSCH",category:["ART","TACKY","COLORFUL"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into kitsch style art.

Reconstruct the subject using bold, fragmented geometric forms arranged in layered, rhythmic patterns. Break the subject into angular planes, curved segments, and modular shapes that feel intentionally constructed rather than organic. The subject must remain recognizable, but only through abstraction and structure.

Use high-contrast color blocks, unexpected color pairings, and sharp edges combined with controlled curves. Depth should be suggested through overlapping shapes, scale shifts, and offset layers rather than realistic perspective.

Incorporate a sense of motion and visual tension, as if the image is vibrating or slightly misaligned. Elements may appear rotated, sliced, staggered, or offset, creating a dynamic, kinetic composition.

Avoid realism, painterly textures, or soft gradients. Surfaces should feel flat, graphic, and deliberate — like a constructed visual system rather than a painting.

The background should support the geometry without competing with it, using negative space, grids, or subtle patterning. Ensure the full composition is visible and balanced within the frame.

The final image should feel modern, experimental, and architectural — a distinctive Kulometric Bansasa interpretation that is visually striking and clearly readable on a small screen.`},{name:"LANDMARKS",category:["TRAVEL","TOURIST","LOCATION","MASTER PROMPT"],message:"Take a picture and place the subject naturally in front of a randomly selected famous world landmark.

The subject’s head must be a smooth, cylindrical LEGO head with **all facial features painted directly onto the head**, including eyes, eyebrows, mouth, expression, facial hair, freckles, glasses, or other defining traits. Do NOT render realistic human heads, sculpted hair, or detailed facial geometry. Any hairstyle or head covering must appear only as a separate LEGO accessory piece (helmet, hat, hair piece), not as part of the head itself.

Translate the subject’s recognizable traits into simplified LEGO-style printed facial graphics while maintaining the iconic LEGO look.

Build the environment entirely from LEGO bricks at toy scale using plates, bricks, tiles, and accessories. Use realistic toy-photography lighting with soft shadows and subtle reflections so the scene looks like a photograph of an actual LEGO diorama.

If the source image contains a visual logo, emblem, icon, symbol, or recognizable graphic mark, recreate a simplified, clean version of that logo at the top of the letterhead. The logo should be visually derived from the image itself (shapes, symbols, icons, or imagery), not generated from appended text. Preserve recognizability while simplifying for professional print use.

If no visual logo is present, construct a refined text-based header using the extracted name or business name, without inventing imagery.

If externally provided information is supplied (such as name, address, phone, email, or website), merge it seamlessly as supporting text beneath or beside the logo or header. Do not transform externally provided text into a logo or symbol.

Design a clean, professional, print-ready letterhead layout. Present the logo or header prominently at the top, followed by secondary details arranged with balanced alignment and spacing. Use modern, understated typography, subtle dividers, restrained color accents, and generous white space. Avoid novelty fonts, decorative graphics, or poster-like styling.

Transform the subject entirely using the Lite-Brite peg layout: the subject’s shape, facial features, and key details must be composed only of circular light pegs aligned to the pegboard grid. Do not use lines, shading, or any elements outside the peg layout to define the subject.

Use bright, saturated colors for each peg with subtle glow and soft bloom to emulate the light pegs. Simplify details as necessary to maintain recognizability while fully adhering to the pegboard constraints.

Avoid photorealism—everything should read clearly as tattoo art, not a photo. Place the tattoo naturally on a realistic skin surface (e.g., forearm, upper arm, shoulder, calf, or back), following proper body curvature, muscle flow, and skin texture. Include realistic ink characteristics such as slight bleed, skin texture with visible pores and hair follicles, natural redness around fresh ink, and subtle shading variations. Ensure the tattoo integrates organically with the skin—correct perspective, natural stretching, soft shadowing, and seamless edges—without looking pasted or flat. The tattoo may include optional framing elements like banners, borders, decorative flourishes, dates, small symbols, or brief text captions if contextually appropriate.

Limit logo generation strictly to the extracted source text. Do not transform, symbolize, or reinterpret any externally appended or supplemental text.

If additional text such as a name, address, phone number, or tagline is provided externally, render that text as literal, readable typography arranged neatly beneath or beside the logo symbol. Maintain clear separation between the logo mark and supporting text.

Render the subject as the missing ‘pet’ — even if the subject is clearly not an animal. The subject should appear naturally integrated into the photo area of the flyer, cropped or posed the way lost pet photos typically are.

Include the following flyer elements in a photocopied, black-and-white or faded color style:
• Large headline: "LOST PET" or "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PET?"
• A short, humorous description based on the subject’s appearance, posture, clothing, or expression (e.g., "Easily distracted," "Responds to snacks," "Last seen avoiding responsibility")
• A vague or absurd last-seen location inspired by the scene or subject
• A reward that is comically low, oddly specific, or useless (e.g., "$7," "half a sandwich," "emotional closure")

Design the shirt using common souvenir t-shirt aesthetics appropriate to the chosen city. Examples include:
• bold block lettering
• playful or cheesy fonts
• city skyline silhouettes
• landmark illustrations
• stars, flags, or decorative borders
• exaggerated colors or slightly faded screen-print ink

The design should look like it was purchased at a tourist gift shop — slightly tacky, mass-produced, and proudly obvious. The print should appear realistically applied to the fabric with natural folds, wrinkles, lighting, and slight distortion from the shirt’s movement.

Ensure the shirt fits naturally on the subject’s body and matches perspective, lighting, and fabric texture. The text must be fully visible and legible on a small screen.

The final image should clearly look like a wax statue of the subject, not a real person, while still closely resembling them.`},{name:"MAGIC EYE",category:["ILLUSION","STEREOGRAM","3D"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a single-image autostereogram (Magic Eye–style illusion). Encode the subject’s shape and depth into a repeating patterned texture so the image appears abstract at first glance but reveals the subject when viewed with relaxed or unfocused eyes.

Use a dense, repeating pattern with subtle depth cues that form the subject’s silhouette and major features in three dimensions. Do not include outlines, labels, or hints. The subject should not be immediately obvious without proper viewing.

Ensure the pattern is clean, evenly tiled, and centered. The final image should resemble a classic Magic Eye print that is visually stable and readable on a small screen.`},{name:"MARIONETTE PUPPET",category:["TOY","PUPPET","STRINGS"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into a handcrafted marionette puppet.

Preserve the subject’s recognizable traits by translating facial characteristics into the mascot head design, not by using the real face. Eyes, mouth, and expression should be part of the costume head.

Use photoreal lighting and materials so the mascot looks like a real person wearing a professional mascot suit, not a cartoon or illustration. Place the mascot in a stadium, field, or arena environment.

Ensure the full mascot body is visible and properly proportioned.

Render the subject in a Mike Judge–style character design: slightly awkward proportions, stiff posture, minimal facial expression, uneven line work, flat cel-shaded colors, and intentionally plain or unflattering details. Preserve the subject’s recognizability while adapting them fully into the cartoon style.

Place the subject INTO a recognizable Mike Judge cartoon scene, selected based on context or randomly. The scene should clearly reflect one of the following shows and environments, and may include recognizable characters from that show:

• King of the Hill — suburban Arlen, Texas (backyard fence chats, alleyways, living rooms, Strickland Propane). Characters may include Hank Hill, Peggy, Bobby, Dale, Bill, or Boomhauer.
• Beavis and Butt-Head — grimy neighborhood streets, living room couch, fast-food joints, school hallways. Characters may include Beavis, Butt-Head, or classmates reacting to the subject.
• Daria — school hallways, classrooms, coffee shops, or suburban interiors. Characters may include Daria, Jane, Quinn, or classmates observing the subject.
• Office Space–style environment — dull corporate office, cubicle farms, break rooms, printer destruction areas. Characters may include bored coworkers or management-style figures inspired by the film’s tone.

Existing characters should appear as supporting or background characters interacting with or reacting to the subject. The subject should feel like a guest character awkwardly dropped into the episode, not replacing anyone.

Adapt the subject’s clothing into simplified everyday outfits typical of Mike Judge cartoons — plain t-shirts, polos, jeans, boring office attire, or aggressively normal suburban clothing.

Use muted, slightly washed-out color palettes, flat lighting, and simple painted backgrounds. Avoid exaggerated animation, flashy effects, or glossy textures.

Ensure the full scene is visible and readable on a small screen, with the subject clearly identifiable among the characters.

Use shallow depth of field, soft studio lighting, and subtle shadows to emulate macro photography of a real miniature model.

Dress the character in classic minion-style overalls or a similar worker outfit. Proportions should be exaggerated and playful, not realistic.

Replace the Mona Lisa’s face with the subject, carefully adapting their facial features, expression, and posture to match the iconic pose, angle, and calm demeanor of the original artwork. The subject should feel painted into the scene, not pasted on.

Render the image in a classical Renaissance oil painting style with soft brushwork, subtle gradients, muted earth tones, and realistic canvas texture. Preserve the iconic background landscape, atmospheric depth, and lighting.

Gently adapt the subject’s hair or accessories into period-appropriate forms while maintaining recognizable traits (for example, modern glasses subtly reinterpreted as period-style frames).

Ensure the full painting is visible within the frame, including the subject, background, and edges of the artwork. The final image should feel like a museum-worthy reinterpretation — respectful, believable, and quietly humorous through contrast.`},{name:"MONDRIAN",category:["ART","GEOMETRIC","ARTIST","ABSTRACT"],message:"Take a picture and reinterpret it in the style of Piet Mondrian.

POTATO HEAD",category:["TOY","RETRO","POTATO"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a Mr. Potato Head–style toy.

Convert the subject into a smooth, potato-shaped plastic body with a slightly shiny, molded toy texture. The subject’s original human facial anatomy MUST NOT remain visible. All facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears, eyebrows) must be represented ONLY as removable Mr. Potato Head–style toy parts.

Important facial replacement rules:
• REMOVE the subject’s real nose, mouth, eyes, and ears entirely
• REPLACE them with toy-style plug-in parts mounted directly onto the potato surface
• Do NOT allow any human facial features to appear behind or beneath the toy parts
• Ensure correct positioning: the toy nose must sit centered above the toy mouth, with clear separation between parts

Arrange classic Mr. Potato Head components — eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, ears, arms, and optional accessories (hat, glasses, mustache) — snapped into visible peg holes or implied mounting points. Parts should feel modular, slightly misaligned, and intentionally toy-like, but never overlapping or duplicated.

Preserve the subject’s identity through:
• eye shape or spacing translated into toy eyes
• mouth expression adapted into a toy mouth
• accessories inspired by the subject (glasses, hat, etc.)

Maintain realistic toy scale, lighting, and soft shadows so the figure appears as a real physical plastic toy photographed in the real world.

Avoid cartoon drawing styles or painterly rendering. This must look like a tangible Mr. Potato Head toy, not an illustration.

Keep the composition clean and centered. Ensure the full toy is visible and clearly readable on small screens. The final image should feel nostalgic, playful, and unmistakably a Mr. Potato Head version of the subject — with no anatomical confusion.`},{name:"MUG SHOT",category:["HUMOR","MASTER PROMPT","POLICE","PHOTO"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and transform it into a realistic police booking photo (mugshot).

Background and framing: Position the subject against a height measurement wall with horizontal lines and measurement markers clearly visible behind them. Use a neutral institutional background with the measurement scale. Camera angle should be straight-on with subject facing forward in standard mugshot pose.

Placement and details: The subject should be holding a placard or booking board displaying booking number, date, and police department name. Generate humorous or descriptive arrest charge text on the placard inspired by the subject's appearance, clothing, expression, or characteristics (examples: 'Public Nudity at Costco,' 'Theft of Garden Gnome,' 'Excessive Karaoke'), incorporating any externally provided details from master prompt naturally.

Subject appearance: Show signs of a rough day - disheveled hair, tired or defiant expression, smudged makeup (if applicable), wrinkled or slightly torn clothing, possibly minor injuries like a black eye or scrapes. Expression can be deadpan, angry, smirking, crying, or showing attitude. Include details suggesting what they were doing when arrested through their outfit or appearance.

Lighting and quality: Use harsh, unflattering institutional fluorescent lighting typical of police stations - flat, bright, casting slight shadows under eyes and emphasizing imperfections. Colors should be slightly washed out or have that institutional quality. Include subtle imperfections typical of ID photography: slightly uneven lighting, mild shadows, imperfect framing, or slight camera artifacts to enhance authenticity.

The final image should look exactly like an actual police booking photograph - institutional, unflattering, official documentation style with that specific harsh government facility aesthetic. Preserve the subject's recognizable facial features, posture, and expression while maintaining a realistic, photorealistic composition that captures the authentic look and feel of a real mugshot.`},{name:"MULTIPLICITY",category:["HUMOR","ABSURD","PHOTO EFFECT"],message:`Take a picture and transform the scene so the subject appears duplicated multiple times within the same frame.

Create several copies of the subject, each placed naturally into the environment with consistent lighting, scale, and perspective. The duplicates should feel like they coexist in the same moment rather than layered edits.

Each version of the subject should have a slightly different pose, expression, or attitude to suggest personality divergence — for example: confident, confused, bored, overexcited, distracted, or plotting.

Avoid obvious repetition. Vary posture, head tilt, facial expression, or interaction with the environment so each duplicate feels intentional.

Keep the composition readable on a small screen. Ensure no duplicate is cropped or partially hidden.

Costumes, props, lighting, and setting should match the original musical style and era.

Optional flavor text from the master prompt can influence the song, scene, or humorous twist (e.g., the subject missing a step, dramatically belting a line, or accidentally knocking over props).

Analyze the number of visible subjects:
• If multiple subjects are present, show all but one touching their index finger to their nose in a synchronized, quick-reaction pose.
• One subject should clearly be "too late" — their finger either not yet touching their nose, hovering just short, or their hand still moving — making it obvious they are now "it."

Body language and facial expressions are critical:
• The non-it subjects should look relieved, smug, amused, or triumphant.
• The subject who is "it" should look surprised, annoyed, resigned, or caught off-guard.

Ensure everyone remains in the same moment in time, as if the action was frozen immediately after the call of "Not it!" No motion blur — clarity is more important than realism.

Do not add text, arrows, or labels. The concept must be communicated purely through pose, gesture, and expression.

Transform the subject accordingly so they appear fully integrated into the nursery rhyme world — not posing on top of it. Costumes, props, environment, and proportions should make the subject look like they belong inside the story.

Render the scene in a whimsical, illustrated storybook style with soft colors, painterly textures, gentle lighting, and classic children’s book charm. Avoid modern objects or settings unless intentionally playful.

Include the **title of the nursery rhyme** prominently and clearly at the top or bottom of the image. Display a **short, complete version of the nursery rhyme text** within the scene in large, legible lettering, styled like a storybook page. All text must be fully visible and readable.

Preserve recognizable facial features while adapting to the distinctive look.

Place the subject in one of the famous factory locations: the chocolate waterfall and river area with candy mushrooms and edible landscape, the golden egg room with geese, the inventing room with experimental candy machines, the television chocolate room with equipment, or other whimsical factory settings filled with oversized candy, colorful pipes, fantastical machinery, and sweet-making equipment.

Surround the subject with other Oompa Loompas working in the factory or preparing to perform, all with matching appearance and costumes. Include the fantastical candy factory environment with vibrant colors, impossible proportions, whimsical industrial equipment, massive candy productions, and magical chocolate-making machinery.

The setting should capture the dreamlike quality of the factory: oversized candy elements, colorful pipes and machinery, sugar crystals, chocolate rivers, candy plants, lollipop trees, or other fantastical sweet-themed environmental details.

Lighting should have that slightly surreal, colorful quality of the original film - warm glowing light, candy-colored illumination, and the magical atmosphere of the factory.

Optional: Position subject as if about to perform or mid-performance of their famous moralizing musical number, with other Oompa Loompas in coordinated poses.

Replace the traditional game head with the subject’s head, adapted into a flat, illustrated style that matches the board aesthetic while remaining recognizable.

Integrate humorous, fictional items into the body cavities inspired by the subject’s traits or environment (e.g., snacks, phone, keys, coffee cup, tangled thoughts). Items should be cartoonish and clearly readable.

Include parody game elements such as:
• Stylized cavity outlines
• Plastic-board textures
• Simplified medical tools (tweezers, wires) as decorative elements
• Playful warning lights or buzz indicators (visual only, no text required)

Do not alter or contradict known historical associations. Secondary enhancement: Use implicit visual inference from the subject’s appearance, clothing, accessories, environment, and expression to enhance symbolism, visual motifs, and flavor text, without overriding factual saint information. Fallback behavior: If no saint name is externally provided, create a clearly labeled symbolic or archetypal “Saint of [inferred theme]” based on implicit inference from the subject. Avoid naming or implying a real historical saint, omit specific feast dates, and present patronage and fun facts as symbolic rather than historical. Design the final image as a compact, mobile-friendly flash card or holy card layout optimized for small screens. Ensure all text is concise, high-contrast, and legible at small sizes, with clear hierarchy and minimal clutter. Maintain visual clarity, balanced composition, and immediate recognizability.

The subject's body, clothing, face, and all features should be constructed from pennies arranged to create three-dimensional form and detail. Use pennies at various angles to catch light differently - some showing Lincoln's profile, others showing the memorial or shield back, creating texture and depth through the varied orientations and tarnish levels of the coins.

Include pennies of different conditions and ages: shiny new copper pennies, aged darker brown pennies, tarnished green pennies, worn smooth pennies. Use this variation to create shadows, highlights, and dimensional depth. Arrange pennies in overlapping patterns like scales or tiles to build up the subject's form.

The entire environment should also be made of pennies - floor, walls, furniture, background objects, everything constructed from stacked, arranged, or layered pennies. Create architectural elements and environmental details through penny arrangements.

Lighting should emphasize the metallic copper surfaces - warm reddish-brown tones, reflective highlights catching on raised coin edges, shadows between overlapping pennies creating depth. The composition should have realistic metallic sheen and texture.

The subject should remain recognizable through the arrangement and density of the pennies - use tighter penny arrangements for detailed areas like the face, looser arrangements for larger surfaces. The three-dimensional form should be clear despite being made entirely of circular coins.

The final image should look like an actual photograph of an elaborate sculpture or installation artwork where everything visible - subject, environment, objects - is constructed from real pennies, creating a unified copper-toned metallic world with impressive detail and dimensional quality.`},{name:"PHOTO BOOTH STRIP",category:["HUMOR","PHOTO","CARTOON","PORTRAIT"],message:`Take a picture of the subject(s) and turn it into a classic photo booth strip with 3-4 frames vertically aligned.

Each frame should show a different funny or exaggerated pose or expression. Include props like hats, glasses, silly signs, or hand gestures to increase humor.

Background should resemble a traditional photo booth curtain, with soft lighting and simple textures. Include slight visual imperfections like film grain, light streaks, or small scratches to emulate a real photo strip.

The final result should feel like a tangible photo booth keepsake, with high readability, playful exaggeration, and a touch of nostalgia.`},{name:"PHOTO PUZZLE",category:["PUZZLE","JIGSAW","ACTIVITY"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a printable jigsaw puzzle layout. Preserve the original photograph clearly while overlaying visible puzzle piece cut lines across the entire image.

Generate a classic jigsaw pattern with interlocking pieces of varied shapes and sizes. Ensure pieces are large enough to be easily cut out and assembled by hand. Avoid overly small or complex pieces. Keep the image centered and unobstructed so the subject remains recognizable even when divided.

Use clean, high-contrast cut lines that are clearly visible on small screens and when printed. Do not add numbers, text, or labels. The final image should look like a ready-to-print puzzle sheet that can be cut out and assembled in real life.`},{name:"PICTIONARY",category:["PUZZLE","HUMOR","GAME"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a classic Pictionary-style drawing.

Render the subject as a rough, hand-drawn black marker sketch on a clean whiteboard or paper background. The drawing should look like it was made quickly by an amateur player under time pressure — uneven lines, simple shapes, minimal detail, and imperfect proportions.

Preserve just enough of the subject’s pose, silhouette, and key features so the intended idea is still recognizable, but clearly simplified into crude line art rather than a realistic portrait.

Optional visual cues may be included sparingly, such as motion lines, arrows, or simple icons (e.g., sweat drops, exclamation marks) to suggest action or intent, as commonly seen in Pictionary drawings.

Do NOT include written words, letters, numbers, labels, or clues. The image must rely entirely on the drawing to communicate the idea.

Frame the image so the entire drawing surface is visible, as if photographed during a real game of Pictionary.

If MALE: Transform into a flamboyant pimp with exaggerated 1970s style - wide-brimmed fur or velvet hat with feather, oversized sunglasses, flashy suit with loud patterns (zebra print, leopard print, bright colors), platform shoes, gold chains and jewelry, fur coat draped over shoulders, cane with ornate handle, confident swagger pose. Expression should be cocky and self-assured.

If FEMALE: Transform into a provocative street worker with exaggerated 1970s style - big teased hair or wig, heavy makeup with dramatic eye shadow and false lashes, revealing outfit with hot pants or mini skirt, fishnet stockings, platform boots or heels, fur jacket or boa, excessive jewelry, confident or sultry pose and expression.

Setting should reflect gritty urban 1970s street environment - neon signs, city street at night, vintage cars in background, period-appropriate storefronts. Lighting should have that warm sodium street light glow mixed with colorful neon.

Style should be photorealistic but capture the over-the-top, exaggerated aesthetic of 1970s exploitation films and blaxploitation cinema. Preserve the subject's recognizable facial features while fully committing to the theatrical costume and styling.

Rebuild the image entirely using a low-resolution pixel grid. The subject must be constructed from visible, square pixels only — no smooth gradients, no blur, no vector lines, and no photographic textures.

Limit the color palette to a small, intentional set (approximately 8–24 colors total). Use flat color blocks with hard pixel edges. Shading should be achieved only through pixel placement and color stepping, not softness or blending.

Preserve the subject’s recognizability through simplified shapes, silhouettes, and key features rather than detail. Facial features, if present, should be minimal and symbolic.

Choose a classic pixel-art style inspired by retro video games (8-bit, 16-bit, or early handheld), but do not copy any specific copyrighted game or character.

Ensure the entire pixel artwork is visible, centered, and readable on a small screen. The final image should feel handcrafted, nostalgic, and unmistakably pixel art — not a filtered photo.`},{name:"PLAYBILL",category:["DOCUMENT","VINTAGE","THEATER","MASTER PROMPT"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a complete, physical Playbill theater program booklet. The entire Playbill booklet must be fully visible within the frame, including the cover, edges, and proportions of a real printed program.

Design the front cover in classic Playbill style, with the bold Playbill header at the top and a theatrical production title beneath it. Feature the subject prominently on the cover as the star performer, rendered in a dramatic or comedic stage pose and integrated naturally into the cover art.

Ensure the subject appears printed on the cover itself, not floating above it, with realistic lighting, paper texture, slight wear, and subtle printing imperfections. Add stage-themed design elements such as curtains, spotlights, marquee lights, or silhouettes to reinforce the theatrical setting.

Include humorous or over-the-top flavor text describing the subject’s role or performance (e.g., 'A One-Person Musical About Snacks,' 'Winner of Seven Imaginary Awards'). All text should be legible and balanced for small screens.

The booklet should appear photographed against a relevant background (theater seat, stage floor, lobby surface, or neutral setting).

Depict the subject as a hand-drawn pencil or charcoal sketch on off-white paper, using strong line work, cross-hatching, and shading to define facial structure and key features.

Simplify and alter details so the sketch is approximate rather than an exact replica of the subject. Preserve general identifying characteristics such as face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hairline, and expression, but introduce small deviations consistent with a sketch from memory.

Use a neutral background with slight paper texture. Add text and police case numbers. The final image should feel serious, observational, and readable on a small screen, reflecting the imperfection of eyewitness recall.`},{name:"POLLOCK",category:["ART","PAINTING","ARTIST","ABSTRACT"],message:"Take a picture and reinterpret it through abstract expressionism inspired by Jackson Pollock.

Design the image to look like a real campaign poster or rally banner with bold typography, patriotic colors, stars, stripes, and dramatic lighting. The subject should appear as a confident candidate or mascot, posed heroically like they are running for office.

Invent a completely fictional, absurd campaign theme based on the subject’s appearance, clothing, pose, or environment — or use external master prompt text as the campaign platform. Examples:
• 'Running for President of Florida'
• 'Vote for Steve: More Coffee, Less Meetings'
• '2028: The Only One Who Knows Where the Remote Is'

Include:
• a fake campaign slogan
• a fictional office or cause
• a large election year (real or ridiculous)

Do NOT reference real politicians, real political parties, or real political issues. Everything must be parody, fictional, and harmless.

The banner should feel like a real political sign or rally poster, but the content should be clearly silly and satirical.

Render the subject with exaggerated facial features, oversized expressions, and bold ink outlines, like a newspaper editorial cartoon. The subject should be the main caricature, not a background figure.

Invent a fictional, humorous issue, campaign, or cause based on the subject’s appearance, posture, clothing, or environment — or use external master prompt text as the cartoon’s theme. Examples:
• 'The Flatulence Shortage'
• 'The War on Baldness'
• 'The Campaign For Less Body Odor'

Place the subject into a symbolic scene that visually represents the joke — such as standing at a podium, arguing with a cartoon object, battling a pile of paperwork, or leading a ridiculous parade.

Include cartoon-style labels on objects, signs, or banners to explain the joke (e.g., 'Too Many Emails', 'Monday Morning', 'Broken Remote Control').

Do NOT reference real political parties, politicians, or real-world political issues. Everything must be fictional, absurd, and clearly satirical.

Render the subject as a central illustration in the style of 18th-century woodcut engravings with bold linework, cross-hatching, and period-accurate colonial American aesthetic. Surround the illustration with aged, yellowed paper showing foxing, stains, and worn edges typical of 1730s–1750s printed almanacs.

Include period-accurate typography using blackletter or colonial serif fonts for headers. Feature a famous Benjamin Franklin saying or proverb prominently on the page in large, clear text, such as 'Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,' 'A penny saved is a penny earned,' or 'Well done is better than well said.' Ensure this saying is the **most prominent text element** and fully visible.

Optionally, add small marginal notes, weather predictions, or astronomical observations in smaller text around the edges. Include decorative borders, flourishes, and printer's ornaments typical of colonial printing. Render realistic ink impressions, slight printing misalignments, and other subtle imperfections to emulate a true 18th-century printed page.

Place the page fully within the frame with a relevant background behind it.

The subject should be constructed entirely as a pop-up paper structure that rises upward from folded paper layers attached to the book’s pages.

The subject must emerge directly from the page through visible folds, hinges, tabs, and layered paper planes. The body, face, and features should be formed from flat paper pieces assembled into a three-dimensional pop-up mechanism, clearly connected to the page surface.

Show the open book with two facing pages visible. The pop-up elements should clearly originate from the folds of the pages and extend upward, as if they would collapse flat when the book is closed.

Use realistic paper textures, visible creases, cut edges, and paper thickness. All materials must look like paper—no skin, fabric, plastic, or realistic surfaces. Lighting and shadows should emphasize the layered paper construction.

Include prominent text reading "WISH YOU WERE HERE" in a large, playful postcard-style font. The text must be clearly legible and feel printed on the card surface.

Add subtle wear details such as rounded corners, slight fading, paper texture, minor creases, or edge wear so the postcard feels handled and mailed.

The subject must be holding a clearly visible protest sign with a humorous, absurd, or lighthearted message inspired by the subject’s appearance, posture, expression, or surrounding context. The message should be playful and harmless (e.g., 'More Snacks, Less Responsibilities,' 'Justice for Left Socks,' 'End Meetings That Could’ve Been Emails'). The exact wording may be influenced by external flavor text or master prompts.

Ensure the sign looks authentic: handmade poster board or cardboard, bold marker lettering, slightly uneven edges, realistic hand grip, and natural perspective distortion. The sign text must be fully readable and entirely visible within the frame.

The environment should resemble a real protest setting (street, park, plaza, sidewalk) with believable crowd density, natural lighting, candid body language, and realistic depth of field. Avoid political slogans, symbols, or identifiable political figures.

The subject should not be isolated or overly centered — they should feel discovered within the crowd. Clothing, expressions, and posture should appear spontaneous and believable.

Preserve the subject’s recognizable identity and integrate them naturally into the scene so the punchline feels intentional and discovered rather than obvious.

The final image should clearly read as a QR code at first glance, using a consistent grid of square black-and-white modules across the entire image. However, when viewed from a moderate distance, the subject’s face or silhouette should become recognizable through natural variations in module density and contrast.

Do NOT place a photographic image inside the QR code. The subject must be constructed entirely from QR-style square modules. No smooth shading, no realistic textures, and no visible photo elements.

Allow the subject’s general facial structure or silhouette to emerge softly from the pattern — eyes, nose, or head shape may be suggested, but only through block clustering and negative space, not sharp outlines or high-detail rendering.

The subject may be centered, but must not overpower the QR pattern. The grid must remain continuous and visually dominant across the entire image.

Include subtle QR-inspired elements such as finder squares or alignment blocks, integrated naturally without framing or spotlighting the subject.

This does NOT need to be a functional or scannable QR code. Treat the QR structure as a visual language, not a technical requirement.

If external master prompt text is provided, let it influence overall density, contrast, or rhythm of the blocks rather than forming readable text.

The subject should be integrated naturally as if they are a family member, friend, or visitor interacting with the characters.

The setting should capture the show's characteristic environment: the modest Miami household interior with 1970s decor, furniture, and styling. Include authentic period details like vintage appliances, wallpaper patterns, family photos on walls, and the warm, lived-in feel of a Cuban-American home.

Capture the show's signature visual aesthetic: slightly grainy film quality from 1970s television production, warm indoor lighting, and the authentic multicamera sitcom look. Use the color palette and lighting that matches the original show's appearance.

The subject should be dressed in period-appropriate 1970s clothing that fits the scene. Their expression and body language should suggest they're part of a typical sitcom moment - family discussion, comedic misunderstanding, cultural clash between generations, or bilingual conversation.

Other characters in the scene should look authentic to the show - maintaining the actors' appearances from the original series. The interaction should feel natural and capture the show's themes of Cuban-American family life, generational differences, and the immigrant experience.

The outfit should mix streetwear with luxury brands.

Accessories and details: Visible tattoos (face, neck, hands), grills or gold teeth optional, perfectly groomed facial hair or clean-shaven, fresh haircut with clean lineup, possibly colored or styled hair.

Pose and expression: Confident, tough, or laid-back attitude - could be throwing up hand signs, leaning against expensive car, holding microphone, showing off jewelry, or in a power stance. Expression should convey swagger, confidence, and star presence.

Setting options: Recording studio with equipment visible, luxury car (Lamborghini, Bentley, Rolls Royce), mansion or penthouse, nightclub VIP section, urban street with graffiti backdrop, or stage with dramatic lighting.

Lighting should be professional - studio quality with dramatic shadows, colored gel lights (purple, blue, red), or high-contrast urban photography style.

• A human with unusual physical abilities or endurance
• A bizarre but real historical record

Place the subject into the scene as the star of this oddity — performing, displaying, or being photographed as the incredible attraction.

Use external master prompt text, if provided, to influence name of subject, which oddity is shown or to add humorous headline flavor.

Include a short sign message such as '[NAME] CROSSING,' 'BEWARE OF [NAME],' or similar wording. Text must be large, centered, and legible from a distance.

Lighting, perspective, and costume should match the film style and era, making it look like a real frame from the movie.

Optional flavor text from the master prompt can influence which film or scene to use, or what absurd twist to add (e.g., subject delivers the iconic line, performs the fencing duel, or sits in the famous diner scene with a ridiculous expression).

The mask MUST be solid white in color. Do NOT use skin tones, flesh colors, beige, pink, or realistic human coloration. The mask should clearly read as a white costume mask.

The mask should be clearly rubbery and costume-like, not realistic or eerie. Use a droopy, stretched face shape with oversized eye holes, exaggerated mouth opening, and slightly uneven proportions. The expression should feel goofy, slack, and intentionally silly rather than threatening.

Subtly adapt the mask to the subject so each render feels unique while staying comedic. Variations may include:
• mouth shape loosely matching the subject’s expression (open, smirking, surprised)
• uneven eye openings influenced by the subject’s eye spacing
• stretched or sagging areas reflecting the subject’s face shape
• molded impressions suggesting glasses or accessories if present

Dress the subject in a loose black hooded robe that looks like a cheap Halloween costume rather than a cinematic outfit. Fabric should appear lightweight, wrinkled, and slightly ill-fitting for comedic effect.

The overall tone must be humorous and absurd, not scary. Do not add blood, weapons, or horror elements. Lighting and composition should feel casual and playful, as if captured during a parody scene.

Transform the subject into this simplified comic style while keeping them recognizable through key features like hairstyle, glasses, facial hair, or distinctive characteristics adapted to the minimalist art style. Use the characteristic Dilbert character proportions - slightly oversized heads on simple rectangular bodies.

Clothing should be office attire - dress shirt, tie, slacks for business look, rendered with simple clean lines and solid colors. Include the signature white collar and simple tie design typical of Dilbert characters.

Setting should be a minimal office cubicle environment - simple desk, computer monitor (rendered as basic rectangles), office chair, cubicle walls. Keep backgrounds sparse and clean with simple straight lines, characteristic of the comic strip's minimal aesthetic.

Expression should capture workplace emotions - deadpan frustration, sarcastic smile, exhausted resignation, or cynical awareness typical of Dilbert's office humor. Keep facial expressions simple but expressive using minimal lines.

Dress the subject in a flowing black hooded robe inspired by the classic Ghostface costume. Ensure the hood frames the mask naturally, with realistic fabric folds, shadows, and texture. Match lighting, perspective, and depth so the costume integrates seamlessly with the original scene.

Break the scene into multiple flat, rigid layers (foreground, midground, background). Each layer must have hard, geometric edges with no feathering, no blur, and no soft transitions. Treat each layer like a physical cutout made from thick card stock or acrylic sheets.

Depth must be created ONLY through layer offset, overlap, scale, and cast shadows — never through photographic depth of field, bokeh, or blur. Shadows should be crisp, directional, and slightly offset to clearly reveal stacking order.

Simplify the subject into bold planar shapes while preserving recognizable silhouette and posture. Remove surface texture and fine photographic detail. Surfaces should appear smooth, matte, and manufactured.

Use a strictly limited calm latte palette: warm ivory, oat beige, sand, almond, soft clay, light mocha, and espresso brown. No saturated colors, no gradients beyond flat tonal steps.

Lighting should feel artificial and diagrammatic, as if lit for a design mockup or museum model, not a real-world photograph.

The final image should resemble a precision-cut, depth-layered design object or editorial poster. It must look constructed, not painted, not photographed, and not illustrated.

Render the image almost entirely in stark black and white with extreme contrast. Use deep, inky blacks and bright whites with very little midtone gray. Lighting should feel harsh, directional, and dramatic, emphasizing silhouettes, shadows, and negative space.

Allow only one or two selective color accents at most (such as red lips, blood-red elements, a glowing cigarette ember, or neon signage). All other elements must remain strictly monochrome.

Convert the subject into a stylized, high-contrast noir figure with sharp edges, heavy shadowing, and simplified facial features. Preserve recognizability through bold shapes and expression rather than realism.

The environment should feel urban and gritty — rain-soaked streets, fire escapes, alleyways, venetian-blind shadows, brick walls, or smoky interiors. Backgrounds may fade into black to heighten drama.

The subject should appear as a small figurine integrated into the miniature city scene — not floating, not full-sized, and not dominating the globe.

Render a clear glass sphere with realistic reflections, refraction, highlights, and slight distortion caused by the curved glass. Floating snow particles or glitter should be suspended throughout the globe at varying depths.

Include a visible snow globe base made of plastic or resin, styled like a tourist souvenir. The base should include a decorative plaque or label showing the city or location name (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a plausible destination name).

The subject must appear inside one of the compartments, clearly visible, as if they are waiting to be dispensed.

Render the humans as intact, clothed, and calm — no distress, no danger, no violence. The tone should be surreal and comedic, not dark. Humans should feel more like oversized gumballs or capsule toys than trapped people.

Include clear visual cues that this is a vending-style system:

In the right frame, introduce **5–7 subtle but clearly noticeable differences** in objects, colors, accessories, or minor details, such as:
• Removing or adding small objects
• Altering colors of items or clothing
• Slightly repositioning accessories or props (without moving the subject)
• Changing minor details of clothing, eyes, haircolor, hairstyle, or props
• Adjusting the size of small items or background elements

Dress the subject in classic stand-up attire appropriate to a comedy club — casual jacket, button-down, t-shirt, or minimalist stage outfit — adapted naturally from the subject’s original clothing when possible.

Include ONE clearly readable on-screen joke caption, presented as part of the performance (subtitle, lower-third, or stage sign). The joke should be EITHER:

• a REAL, VERBATIM one-liner (under 90 characters) from a famous one-liner comedian, OR

When using a verbatim joke, randomly select from the comedic voices of:

Transform the subject to match Tim Burton's signature visual style: pale skin with dark shadows under eyes, exaggerated features, elongated proportions, wild unkempt hair (often black with dramatic styling), dramatic makeup with dark eyes, gothic or quirky costume design with striped patterns, mismatched fabrics, Victorian-inspired clothing, or unusual color combinations (black, white, purple, deep reds).

Place the subject within an iconic scene from the chosen film with other characters from that movie present. The environment should capture Burton's distinctive aesthetic: twisted architecture, spiraling designs, forced perspective, gothic elements mixed with whimsy, stark contrast between light and shadow, surreal proportions, and his signature color palette.

The subject should be styled as if they belong in that specific Burton film - whether as a suburban character with pastel gothic twist, a stop-motion animated figure, a striped-suit wearing ghost, a gothic creature, or Victorian-era character depending on which film is selected. Preserve recognizable features while adapting them to Burton's exaggerated, slightly macabre artistic vision.

Lighting should be dramatic with strong contrasts - deep shadows, pools of light, moonlit scenes, or that distinctive Burton glow. The atmosphere should feel both whimsical and slightly dark, fantastical yet melancholic.

The final image should look like an actual still from a Tim Burton film - gothic, whimsical, visually striking, with exaggerated proportions and that unmistakable Burton aesthetic. The subject should be seamlessly integrated into the film's world alongside other iconic characters from that movie.`},{name:"TIME DILATION",category:["SCI FI","TIME","MOTION"],message:"Take a picture and depict the image as if time is slowed or fractured.

The tiny versions should act like living building blocks, posed and arranged to define edges, shading, and structure. From a distance, the subject must read clearly as a complete human figure; up close, the image must resolve entirely into individual miniature subjects.

Add ear hair visibly growing out from the ear openings - bushy tufts that are clearly overgrown and neglected.

The subject's facial hair (if applicable) should also be scraggly, patchy, or unkempt. Overall hair should look messy and in need of a cut.

The subject's expression can be neutral, unaware, or even proud - making the lack of grooming more humorous. Alternatively, they could look disheveled and tired.

The subject's image should be converted into glowing neon tubing and illuminated sign elements. Their facial features, silhouette, and recognizable characteristics should be rendered using bright neon tubes in classic Vegas colors - hot pink, electric blue, bright red, golden yellow, vibrant purple, lime green.

Sign construction details: The neon should have realistic glass tube appearance with visible glowing gas, support brackets and framework visible, bulb marquee borders surrounding the main image, animated chasing lights or blinking elements, possibly text above or below saying the subject's name in classic Vegas marquee lettering.

Mount the sign prominently on the side of an authentic Las Vegas casino building - art deco or mid-century modern architecture, visible in evening or night setting. Include surrounding Vegas context: other neon signs visible in background, palm trees, busy street below with car light trails, other casinos in distance.

Lighting and atmosphere: The scene should be photographed at dusk or night when neon is most vibrant. The sign should be the brightest element, casting colorful glow on the building facade. Include atmospheric haze or slight blur to enhance the neon glow effect. Light from the sign should reflect on surrounding surfaces.

The animal should behave like a person while still clearly being an animal. Use proper perspective, props, and body positioning so it looks natural and believable.

• If the subject is a HUMAN: transform them into a pet owned by an animal. The human should be on a leash, being carried, sitting in a pet carrier, or being walked by a dog, cat, or other animal. The animal must clearly be the owner and in control.

The scene should be funny but not mean-spirited — playful, surreal, and instantly understandable at a glance.

Maintain realistic lighting, scale, and contact between characters so the interaction feels physically real. The subject must be fully integrated into the scene, not pasted on.

Include a handwritten yard-sale sign nearby with casual marker lettering and uneven lines. Surround the subject with typical yard sale items like folding tables, boxes, old toys, lamps, or clothes racks.

Use natural daylight and slightly cluttered suburban surroundings to sell the realism. The subject should feel like an object for sale, not a person shopping at the sale.
