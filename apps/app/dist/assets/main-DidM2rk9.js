• Muscles and sweat
• Hero pose with weapon
• Villain or henchmen visible

SETTING DETAILS:

The image should look like a posed flash photograph from the 1980s: harsh on-camera flash, flat lighting, soft focus, slight film grain, and muted color tones. Include typical prom decorations such as metallic balloons, crepe paper, tinsel, streamers, and a banner with the school name and graduation year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a generic school name and year).

Dress all subjects in unmistakably tacky 1980s prom attire. Examples include oversized tuxedos, pastel or ruffled dresses, lace gloves, corsages, bow ties, cummerbunds, sequins, and shiny fabrics. Hairstyles must be exaggerated and era-accurate: big teased hair, feathered bangs, mullets, perms, or excessive hairspray volume.

Subject logic:
• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears masculine, add an older woman who plausibly looks like the subject’s mother as the prom date. She should be dressed formally but slightly out of place.
• If there is ONE subject and the subject appears feminine, add a younger boy who plausibly looks like a younger brother as the prom date. He should appear underdressed or uncomfortable.
• If there are TWO human subjects, present them as prom dates together, standing close but visibly awkward, stiff, or uncomfortable.

Body language should feel forced and uncomfortable: stiff smiles, arms held too rigidly, hands awkwardly placed, or obvious personal space tension. No one should look confident or natural.

Ensure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed prom photo.

The subject must be styled, dressed, and posed to clearly match a specific music genre and era inferred from their appearance, expression, clothing, environment, or mood. The visual aesthetic must strongly reflect a historically appropriate vinyl-era release year. For example:
• 1960s–70s Rock → analog grain, warm tones, natural light, leather or denim
• 1970s Disco → glossy photography, bold colors, dramatic poses
• 1980s Pop → neon accents, airbrushed look, studio lighting
• 1990s Grunge / Hip-hop → gritty texture, muted colors, urban realism
• 1950s–60s Jazz → monochrome or sepia, elegant composition
• Punk → raw, DIY photocopy look

If the genre is unclear, choose the most fitting genre and era based on the subject’s vibe and surroundings.

Design the image as a complete, square vinyl record cover. The subject must be clearly identifiable as the singer or band front-person, fully integrated into the composition — not pasted in. Lighting, color grading, and framing must feel intentional and era-accurate.

Add album typography directly onto the cover:
• Artist name (based on the subject or a humorous alias inspired by them)
• Album title (creative and genre-appropriate)
• A clearly visible tracklist arranged in a vinyl-typical layout
• A release year prominently displayed that matches the visual era (e.g., 1977, 1984, 1993)

The track names should collectively tell a loose story or emotional arc inspired by the subject’s appearance, pose, or environment. Titles should feel believable for the chosen genre and decade.

Optionally include era-appropriate vinyl details such as:
• Record label logo
• Catalog number
• Stereo / Mono indicator
• Parental Advisory label (only if appropriate for the genre)

The doll’s face should retain the subject’s recognizable facial structure, proportions, and expression, but be rendered with smooth plastic skin, simplified features, glossy eyes, and the polished look of a physical Barbie or Ken toy.

Environmental logic:
• If the scene appears indoors, place the subject inside a Barbie Dreamhouse interior with pastel-colored plastic furniture, toy-like proportions, and miniature physical details.
• If the scene appears outdoors, place the subject inside or next to a Barbie convertible with realistic toy textures, bright colors, and a glossy finish.

Use high-key lighting, realistic toy textures, reflections, and scale consistency to ensure the subject and environment appear as physical toys rather than drawings or digital illustrations.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: No photographic pixels, skin, fabric, metal, plastic, paper, or real-world materials may remain.

The subject, clothing, facial features, hair, background, environment, objects, shadows, and depth must ALL be constructed entirely from candy materials.

DO NOT apply candy textures to a photo.
DO NOT overlay candy on top of existing objects.
DO NOT trace, mask, silhouette, or reuse the original photograph’s structure.

The image must look as if the original photograph never existed and was replaced by a fully constructed candy sculpture world.

Candy materials may include (used structurally, not decoratively):
• Gummies (gummy worms, gummy bears)
• Gumballs
• Hard candy (Werther’s Originals, Nerds, Jolly Ranchers)
• Chocolate (Tootsie Rolls, Hershey’s Kisses)

Lighting must behave like real candy:
• Glossy highlights
• Sticky reflections
• Subsurface glow in translucent candies
• Slight melting, sagging, or stretching where appropriate

FINAL VALIDATION RULE:
If the image looks like a normal photograph with candy placed on top, IT IS WRONG.

The final image must look like a real, physical candy sculpture or candy-built environment photographed in real lighting.`},{name:"CARDBOARDALITY",category:["SURREAL","ILLUSION","HUMOR","REALISM"],message:`Take a picture and transform the scene so ONE subject appears as a life-size cardboard cutout, like the kind used for photo opportunities at events or theaters.

CORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):
• Exactly ONE subject is converted into a cardboard standee
• All other people remain completely normal and photographic
• The cardboard figure must be full human scale
• The illusion must be immediately recognizable as a cardboard cutout

SUBJECT SELECTION LOGIC:
• If ONE subject is visible: that subject becomes the cardboard cutout
• If TWO OR MORE subjects are visible:
  – Choose ONLY ONE subject to become the cardboard cutout
  – All remaining subjects stay real and unaffected

CARDBOARD CONSTRUCTION RULES (CRITICAL):
• The subject appears printed onto flat cardboard
• Visible cardboard edge thickness around the silhouette
• Slightly uneven or hand-cut outline
• Matte, slightly desaturated printed surface

• Perspective and scale must match the real room

CAMERA & LIGHTING:
• Normal, everyday photography
• Lighting affects the cutout evenly, like a printed surface
• No dramatic spotlighting or surreal effects

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
• No partial cardboard transformation
• No realistic skin texture or depth
• No floating or leaning without support
• No converting more than one subject

TONE:
• Playful
• Deadpan
• Slightly absurd
• Grounded in reality

If there are TWO subjects in the image: Have one subject carrying the other on their shoulders. Choose based on context, size, or humor - the carrier should look strained, proud, or playfully struggling while the person being carried shows excitement, triumph, or awkward balance.

If there is only ONE subject in the image: A famous person (specified via master prompt, or choose an appropriate celebrity if none specified) will either carry the subject on their shoulders OR the subject will carry the famous person. The interaction should feel natural and humorous.

Both people should have realistic expressions: the carrier might show effort, determination, or playful annoyance; the person on shoulders might show joy, victory, fear of falling, or awkward balance with arms outstretched.

Preserve recognizable facial features and body proportions for all people. The physical interaction must look believable - proper hand placement on legs/thighs, realistic weight distribution, natural body positioning.

Set the scene in an appropriate context: concert crowd, celebration, sporting event victory, parade, beach, park, or casual outdoor setting. Include realistic background elements and other people reacting to the moment.

Lighting and photography should be photorealistic, as if captured during an actual candid moment.

Use a tall portrait aspect ratio (about 9:16 or taller). The subject should be the main character of the ‘phone,’ either as the lock-screen wallpaper or as a character integrated into the interface.

Overlay a fake phone UI including:
• a fake clock and date
• silly or themed app icons inspired by the subject’s traits (e.g., "Fart Tracker", "Overthinking", "Drama Meter", "Nap Mode")
• fake battery, Wi-Fi, and signal indicators with humorous labels

Add subtle cracked-glass lines across the screen — fine hairline fractures, small chips, or spiderweb cracks — so it looks like a phone with a lightly damaged display. The cracks should sit on top of the image like real broken glass, but must not block the subject’s face or important UI text.

Design the interface so it feels like a real smartphone screen but with absurd, playful details. Icons should be large, readable, and placed naturally like a real phone home screen.

Leave the top and bottom areas clear enough that the subject’s face or main features are not blocked by UI elements.

The humor comes from the implication and overreaction of censorship.

CENSORSHIP TYPE SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt suggests a specific censorship type, USE THAT TYPE
• If no type is provided externally, SELECT EXACTLY ONE type using the RANDOM SEED
• Use the LAST TWO DIGITS of the RANDOM SEED modulo 10:
  - 0: Black censorship bar over eyes (like witness protection)
  - 1: Pixelated blur over face or object
  - 2: Large "CENSORED" text banner covering part of image
  - 3: Black rectangles blocking out random innocent objects
  - 4: Cartoon-style sign with symbols (stars, spirals, @#$%!) held in front of mouth

CORE REQUIREMENTS:
• Subject's features should still be somewhat recognizable despite censorship
• Nothing actually inappropriate in the original or censored image
• Censorship applied to completely innocent things for comedic effect
• Over-the-top dramatic censorship treatment
• The absurdity comes from censoring normal, harmless content

CENSORSHIP APPLICATION:

• For option 6: Subject positioned with arm outstretched, hand prominently blurred or pixelated to imply offensive gesture
• Make it look official and serious despite censoring nothing scandalous
• Can include warning labels like "VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED" or "INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT REMOVED"
• Official-looking "CENSORED BY [AUTHORITY]" stamps

STYLE:
• Realistic censorship graphics (actual blur effects, official-looking bars)
• High contrast black bars or bright pixelation

• Can include fake ratings labels (MATURE, EXPLICIT, etc.) for comedic effect

HUMOR APPROACH:
• Suggest something scandalous while showing something completely benign
• Censorship is disproportionate to actual content
• Multiple unnecessary censorship layers
• Comedic overreaction to innocent imagery
• Parody of media censorship and content warnings

FINAL RESULT:
An image with dramatic, official-looking censorship applied to completely innocent elements, creating humor through the implication that something inappropriate is being hidden when nothing scandalous exists. The subject should be recognizable but the absurd over-censorship of normal objects creates the comedy.`},{name:"CERAMIC FIGURINE",category:["TOY","COLLECTIBLE","MINIATURE"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into a small ceramic figurine.

• Light may illuminate strands but may NOT reveal hidden images

FINAL VALIDATION TEST:
If removing the spider silk would reveal a normal image underneath, THE RESULT IS WRONG.

The final image must look like a real macro photograph of a spider web that magically forms a subject and text through silk alone.`},{name:"CHAVO DEL OCHO",category:["TV","COMEDY","MEXICAN","RETRO","SITCOM"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a character from the classic Mexican television show El Chavo del Ocho.

If the subject is MALE: Transform them into either Quico or El Chavo del Ocho. Preserve the subject's recognizable facial features while adapting their appearance to match the character's iconic look - period-appropriate clothing from the 1970s Mexican sitcom, characteristic hairstyle, and the comedic expression associated with the character. El Chavo wears his iconic barrel-striped shirt and cap, while Quico wears his sailor suit or formal attire.

If the subject is FEMALE: Transform them into La Chilindrina. Preserve recognizable facial features while adapting to her iconic appearance - including her signature freckles, pigtails with bows, colorful patterned dress, and thick-framed glasses. Capture her mischievous, playful expression.

The setting should reflect the show's environment: the vecindad (neighborhood courtyard), with its characteristic architecture, stairs, doorways, and the nostalgic 1970s Mexican aesthetic. Include warm, slightly vintage color tones and lighting that matches the show's classic filmed appearance.

The transformation should be photorealistic but capture the comedic, innocent, and nostalgic spirit of the beloved show. Expressions should be playful, exaggerated, or characteristic of the specific character's personality - El Chavo's innocent confusion, Quico's spoiled bratty attitude, or La Chilindrina's clever mischievousness.

Maintain the subject's identity while fully immersing them in the iconic visual world of El Chavo del Ocho with period-accurate costumes, setting, and the show's signature warm, nostalgic atmosphere.`},{name:"CHEAP REALITY",category:["SURREAL","UNDERPRODUCED","COMEDY","REALITY GLITCH"],message:`Take a picture and recreate the scene as if reality itself were underproduced, incomplete, and cheaply constructed.

CORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):
• This is real reality, not a set, not a game, not a parody
• The universe looks rushed, low-budget, and unfinished
• Everything technically works, but barely

CHEAP CONSTRUCTION RULES (CRITICAL):
• Surfaces may be unfinished, mismatched, or incomplete
• Materials feel low-cost, improvised, or substituted
• Reality looks like it shipped before it was ready

UNDERPRODUCTION ARTIFACTS (MANDATORY — MIX SEVERAL):
• Missing textures (flat gray, beige, or default surfaces)
• Placeholder geometry (simple cubes, planes, cylinders)
• Wireframe bleed-through on edges or corners
• UV seams and texture stretching
• Repeated low-resolution textures
• Hard edges where detail should exist

IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS:
• NO loading bars
• NO progress meters
• NO "loading" text
• NO UI indicators

ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS:
• Walls, floors, and objects may show:
  – Default material colors
  – Abrupt transitions between finished and unfinished areas
  – Geometry clipping or overlap
  – Simplified shapes replacing complex forms
• Some objects may look like stand-ins for what they represent

SUBJECT INTEGRATION:
• Subject behaves completely normally
• Subject accepts the cheapness as expected reality
• No reaction, awareness, or comedy posing
• Subject is not stylized or exaggerated

PHYSICS & LOGIC:
• Physics remain correct and consistent
• Gravity, scale, and perspective are accurate
• The failure is visual fidelity, not physical law

LIGHTING:
• Flat, default, or utilitarian lighting
• Inconsistent light quality between areas is acceptable
• No cinematic or dramatic lighting

CAMERA:
• Observational, neutral framing
• No stylized angles or effects
• Feels like an unremarkable photograph

TONE:
• Dry, existential, quietly absurd
• No jokes or visual gags
• Humor emerges from inevitability and neglect

FINAL RESULT:
The image must look like genuine reality rendered with missing assets, placeholder geometry, and incomplete visual fidelity — as if the universe was released underfunded and unfinished, yet everyone inside it continues as if nothing is wrong.`},{name:"CHECKMATE",category:["HUMOR","CHESS","GAME","STRATEGIC"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into ALL the chess pieces from one side (either white or black) positioned on an actual chessboard.

The subject's facial features, expressions, and personality should be adapted into EACH of the six different chess piece types: King, Queen, Rook (2), Knight (2), Bishop (2), and Pawn (8). Each piece should be a miniature sculptural version of the subject, maintaining recognizable identity while adapted to the specific piece's form and role.

Design variations for each piece type:
- KING: Subject with crown, regal posture, tallest and most ornate
- QUEEN: Subject with elaborate crown/headpiece, powerful stance, second tallest
- BISHOPS: Subject with pointed mitre hat, diagonal-moving poses
- KNIGHTS: Subject with horse-themed elements, dynamic action poses
- ROOKS: Subject as tower/castle form, strong geometric base
- PAWNS: Subject in simplified form, smallest and most numerous

All pieces should follow classic Staunton chess piece proportions but personalized with the subject's features, clothing details, or characteristics. Each piece should be clearly identifiable as both the subject AND the chess piece type.

Arrange all 16 pieces (1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns) in proper starting chess positions on a realistic wooden or marble chessboard. Include opposing traditional chess pieces on the other side for context and scale.

Lighting should be dramatic and strategic, casting shadows that emphasize the three-dimensional sculptural quality of each piece. Use proper perspective showing the full board setup.

The final image should look like a photograph of a complete custom chess set where every piece on one side is a personalized version of the subject, ready for an actual game. The subject becomes an entire army of chess pieces, not just one.`},{name:"CHEER-LEADER",category:["HUMOR","SPORTS","COSTUME"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a female cheerleader regardless of their gender.

The result should be playful, confident, and clearly recognizable as a cheerleader scene.`},{name:"CHEESE TOUCH",category:["HUMOR","FOOD","ABSURD"],message:`Take a picture and transform the entire scene as if everything has been infected by a mysterious 'cheese touch.'

Convert the subject, clothing, nearby objects, and visible environment into cheese-based versions of themselves. Use a variety of recognizable cheeses (cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella, brie, blue cheese, etc.) with appropriate textures, holes, melts, crumbles, and rinds.

The subject should still be clearly identifiable, but their skin, hair, and clothing should appear sculpted from cheese rather than flesh or fabric. Objects should retain their original shapes but be unmistakably made of cheese.

Avoid cartoon flatness — cheese should look tactile, slightly glossy or matte depending on type, with realistic imperfections. Use playful lighting to emphasize texture.

Ensure the entire composition remains readable on a small screen. The result should feel ridiculous, slightly disturbing, and very funny — as if reality itself has turned into cheese.`},{name:"CHILDHOOD VERSION",category:["AGE","TRANSFORMATION","YOUNG"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a realistic younger version of themselves, depicting natural age regression while preserving identity.

• Party or outdoor gathering → Budweiser
• Family or wholesome setting → classic Coca-Cola or cereal ads

Place the subject directly INTO the commercial as if they are the main actor or spokesperson, fully integrated into the scene rather than pasted on. Adapt wardrobe, pose, expression, and lighting so the subject naturally belongs in the advertisement.

Recreate the commercial’s iconic visual language: era-appropriate color grading, film grain, lighting style, set design, camera framing, and product placement. Use a cinematic still-frame composition that feels like a paused moment from a TV ad.

Include a famous, recognizable tagline from the chosen commercial displayed clearly within the scene (on-screen text, signage, packaging, or lower-third caption). The tagline must be fully visible, legible, and feel naturally embedded in the ad design.

If a real brand logo or product appears in the original image or is provided via external master prompt, prioritize selecting that brand’s commercial.

Ensure the full frame is visible with no cropping of the subject, product, or tagline.

The **overall cloud shape must follow the subject’s silhouette, posture, and proportions**. The subject’s outline governs the form.

Determine the cloud **type** as follows:
• If the subject is animate (person or animal), select the cloud type based on the subject’s apparent emotion:

Use their distinctive visual style: perfectly composed symmetrical framing, absurdist dark comedy situations, eccentric character styling, and deadpan cinematography. Show the subject as a quirky character in an oddball situation - perhaps caught in circumstances beyond their control with a bewildered or stoic expression. Include Coen Brothers elements from the selected film: retro Americana settings, vintage cars, small-town locations, period-specific costumes and props. Use their characteristic lighting - naturalistic but carefully composed, often featuring golden hour warmth or harsh fluorescent interiors. Capture their blend of dark humor and existential dread - situations that are simultaneously funny and unsettling. Make it look like a frame from the selected film with that unique Coen Brothers tone with the subject and additional characters from that film integrated seamlessly into the world.`},{name:"COINED",category:["MONEY","METALLIC","HISTORICAL","PORTRAIT","MASTER PROMPT"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject's portrait onto the face of a coin. The subject's head should appear in profile or three-quarter view as embossed relief on the coin's surface, rendered in metallic texture - gold, silver, bronze, or copper. Show the portrait raised from the coin surface with dimensional depth and shadow, as if minted or stamped into metal. Surround the portrait with coin text elements around the rim. If master prompt text is provided, incorporate that text as the inscription on the coin - either around the rim, below the portrait, or as the motto. If no master prompt text is provided, use traditional coin phrases like denomination, year, country name, or Latin phrases ('E PLURIBUS UNUM', 'IN GOD WE TRUST'). Include decorative borders, stars, or laurel wreaths. The coin style can vary from ancient Roman/Greek coins with profile emperors, to medieval coins with crowned monarchs, to modern presidential coins with contemporary styling. Include authentic numismatic details: edge ridges (reeding), metallic patina or tarnish, slight wear showing age, that characteristic coin relief depth. The entire composition should be circular showing the full coin face. Use realistic metal textures - reflective highlights on raised surfaces, shadows in recessed areas, authentic metallic sheen.

Show the page with coloring supplies nearby - colored pencils, crayons, or markers, maybe a partially colored section demonstrating the process. The outlines should be clean and bold for easy following. Include typical activity book elements: page number in corner, title 'Color By Numbers', possibly difficulty rating or age recommendation.

• Preserve eye shape, nose, mouth, facial structure — just change the COLOR
• Subject still looks like themselves, just in hero's skin color

MASK/HELMET VISIBILITY (CRITICAL):
• If hero wears FULL MASK or FULL HELMET (covering entire face), the mask/helmet MUST be:
  - Removed completely, OR
  - Partially removed (lifted up, pulled back), OR

• The final image must show the COMPLETE comic book cover
• All four corners of the comic visible

• **Employee Name:** Generate a humorous but plausible name based on the subject’s appearance, expression, or clothing (unless overridden by external master prompt).
• **Job Title:** Create a funny or exaggerated job title inspired by the subject’s visible traits or environment (e.g., "Senior Snack Analyst," "Head of Vibes," "Chief Button Presser").
• **Employee ID Number:** Use a fictional numeric or alphanumeric code.
• **Department:** Optional, humorous department name derived from context.

Include a **company name and logo**:
• If a real company logo or branding is visible in the image, adapt the logo.

The conspiracy theme should be automatically invented based on the subject’s appearance, environment, or actions — OR be influenced by external master prompt text if provided (for example: "pizza", "aliens", "taxes", "office drama", "time travel", etc.).

Use absurd, humorous conspiracy logic. Examples:
• 'Always near the coffee machine'

• 'Knows too much about Tuesdays'
• 'Connected to the dog somehow'

Do not include readable real-world sensitive data. All notes should be fictional, funny, and harmless.

The final image must resemble a single sheet of copier paper viewed flat and fully visible within the frame, including paper edges and margins. Do not crop the page.

The subject should appear distorted from being pressed against the glass: flattened features, slightly squashed face or objects, widened nose, compressed cheeks, stretched hands or fingers, and uneven contact areas. The distortion should feel physical and silly, not warped digitally.

Apply classic photocopier artifacts: harsh black-and-white or muddy grayscale tones, blown highlights, crushed shadows, toner speckling, faint streaks, edge shadows from the copier lid, uneven exposure, and slight skew or rotation. Include faint dust marks or smudges typical of a well-used office copier.

Lighting should feel internal to the copier — flat, overexposed, and directionless — not like studio lighting. The background should be blank or show subtle shadows from the copier lid.

Optionally include a small copier interface imprint or margin text such as page numbers, contrast indicators, or misaligned registration marks, rendered faintly and partially cut off.

Place the subject seated at a courtroom table or in the witness stand, with simplified figures of a judge, lawyers, or jury in the background.

Add subtle emotion based on the subject’s expression or posture — nervous, confused, smug, bored, or guilty — even if they are innocent.

Include a small caption area or handwritten label such as "The Defendant" or "Key Witness" (do not include real names unless provided via master prompt).

The subject's face, body, and features must be created ENTIRELY FROM the contrast between flattened crops and standing crops - NOT a picture placed on a field. Use only flattened grain (darker, pressed-down wheat laid in swirled patterns) and standing grain (lighter, upright golden wheat) to build the image. The subject's portrait should be constructed like pointillism or halftone printing - areas of flattened crops create darker tones and shadows, areas of standing crops create lighter tones and highlights, and the pattern of which sections are flattened versus standing forms their recognizable likeness. The portrait should be recognizable from aerial view using geometric patterns, circles, lines, and curves typical of crop circle formations. Include authentic crop circle characteristics: precisely flattened grain stalks laid in directional swirls (clockwise or counterclockwise), sharp edges between flattened and standing crops, multiple concentric circles, connecting pathways, sacred geometry elements. Show the massive scale - the crop circle should span hundreds of feet across the field. Use aerial photography perspective as if photographed from helicopter or drone, showing surrounding farmland, field boundaries, trees at edges, perhaps a road or farmhouse for scale reference. Include subtle details suggesting mysterious origin - perfectly geometric precision, overnight appearance. The lighting should be golden hour with long shadows emphasizing the depth and dimension of the flattened patterns, making the contrast between pressed-down and standing grain more dramatic.

Place them at a wedding reception, school dance, or family party. Include mortified teenagers (presumably their kids) in the background covering their faces, other dads joining in enthusiastically, and normal dancers clearing space around the dad dance zone. The subject should have pure joy and zero self-awareness on their face. Add disco ball lighting, DJ booth, or party decorations.

Dress the subject in an over-the-top, flashy dance costume — sequins, rhinestones, dramatic colors, exaggerated styling — appropriate for professional ballroom dancing.

Pose the subject mid-dance in a way that clearly suggests they do NOT know how to dance: awkward posture, stiff limbs, off-balance stance, mistimed spin, or exaggerated confusion. The humor should come from the contrast between the elegant setting and the subject’s obvious lack of dance skill.

Place the subject on a polished ballroom stage with dramatic lighting, spotlight beams, glossy floors, and a cheering audience in the background. The environment should feel high-budget and televised.

Optionally include subtle show elements like judges’ tables, score paddles, or stage graphics — without copying logos.

  - 89: "At first, I thought if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be 'Clark Kent, Dentist,' because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, 'How's my back tooth?' and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, 'Oh it's okay,' then the patient would probably say, 'Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?' and you'd say, 'I did,' and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill."
  - 90: "If you're having a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball.

I remember a bigger, older guy we called 'Dad.' We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you."

Render the subject’s face as an engraved-style portrait suitable for currency printing. Preserve recognizable facial structure and expression, but translate it into fine linework, cross-hatching, and stippling so it looks printed, not photographic. The portrait should feel integrated into the bill design, not pasted on.

Design the bill with traditional currency elements:
• Ornamental borders and scrollwork
• Decorative frames and rosettes
• Serial numbers (fictional)
• Treasury-style seals (parody, non-official)

Use only black dots on white or continuous feed printer paper with the characteristic green and white horizontal stripes and perforated tear-off edges on both sides (tractor feed holes). Show authentic dot matrix printing artifacts: slight misalignment of dots, banding where print head passed, individual dot visibility, no smooth gradients only dithered dot patterns, jagged diagonal lines, pixelated curves. The dots should be clearly visible as individual impacts from the print head pins. Include printer paper details: continuous fan-fold paper, perforated edges with sprocket holes, slight yellowing, that distinctive matte printer paper texture. Add printing imperfections: ink smudging, lighter sections where ribbon was fading, slight horizontal line patterns from print head movement, occasional missing dots from dead pins. The image should have very low resolution appearance - approximately 72-180 DPI equivalent, with all details reduced to dot patterns.

• Visible brush strokes, uneven repainting, smeared paint
• Cracked plaster or wall texture beneath paint
• Colors slightly muddy or mismatched, as if an amateur attempted the restoration

IDENTITY PRESERVATION:
• The subject must still be faintly recognizable despite the failed restoration
• Facial structure and general likeness should be present but poorly executed

COMPOSITION:
• Frame the image as a photograph of the restored artwork on a wall
• Optional plaque or wall label suggesting it was recently restored

FINAL RESULT:
The image should clearly look like a well-meaning but disastrous art restoration where the subject’s face became unintentionally funny, awkward, or infamous — as if the artwork went viral for all the wrong reasons.`},{name:"EDO LANDSCAPE",category:["ART","ASIAN","JAPANESE","LANDSCAPE"],message:"Take a picture and transform it in the style of Japanese Edo period landscape prints.

Render the subject using continuous, thin, single-line strokes characteristic of Etch A Sketch drawings. Use simple outlines and minimal detail while preserving the subject’s recognizable shape and expression. The drawing should appear slightly imperfect, with subtle line wobble and overlaps consistent with manual knob control.

TRAIT SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt specifies a trait, USE THAT TRAIT
• If none is specified, SELECT EXACTLY ONE using the PRE-CALCULATED values
• These values are MANDATORY - you MUST use them for selection
• Use LAST TWO DIGITS modulo 12:
  - 0: Ears - dramatically enlarged ears (replacing normal ears completely, not adding to them)
  - 1: Nose - significantly enlarged nose (subject's nose grown huge, not an extra nose)
  - 2: Eyes - much larger eyes (subject's existing eyes enlarged, not additional eyes)
  - 3: Mouth - oversized mouth and lips (subject's mouth expanded, same mouth not duplicated)
  - 4: Hair - extremely voluminous or long hair (subject's hair massively increased)
  - 5: Chin - prominent elongated chin (subject's chin extended dramatically)
  - 6: Forehead - enlarged forehead (subject's existing forehead expanded upward)
  - 7: Hands - oversized hands (subject's hands grown disproportionately large)

  - 9: Height - extremely tall (subject stretched vertically to great height)
  - 10: Width - dramatically widened (subject expanded horizontally)
  - 11: Neck - elongated giraffe-like neck (subject's neck stretched very long)

EXAGGERATION RULES (CRITICAL):
• ONLY the selected trait is exaggerated - all other features remain normal
• The exaggerated feature REPLACES the normal feature, not adds to it
• NO duplication - if ears are enlarged, the original small ears don't also exist
• The transformation is OF the existing feature, not an addition
• Subject's original feature is gone, replaced by the enlarged version
• Anatomically coherent - the feature connects properly to the body
• Natural lighting and shadows on the exaggerated feature
• Feature integrated seamlessly

PRESERVE IDENTITY:
• Subject remains clearly recognizable
• All other facial features normal size
• Only ONE trait exaggerated per image
• Face proportions otherwise maintained
• Expression natural
• Body otherwise normal (unless body part is the exaggerated trait)

VISUAL INTEGRATION:
• Exaggerated feature blends naturally with body
• Proper lighting and shadows
• Anatomically plausible connection points
• Skin tone and texture consistent
• No visible seams or photoshop artifacts
• Feature looks genuinely part of the subject

STYLE OPTIONS:
• Photorealistic exaggeration
• OR caricature illustration style
• Playful but not grotesque
• Humorous but not disturbing
• Could be portrait or full-body depending on trait

DEGREE OF EXAGGERATION:
• Noticeable and comedic
• 2-3x normal size for facial features
• 4-5x for body parts like hands/feet
• Extreme but not impossible-looking
• Striking visual impact

SETTING:
• Neutral background to emphasize exaggeration
• OR everyday setting showing how trait affects daily life
• Good lighting to show the exaggerated feature clearly
• Subject posed naturally despite exaggeration

FINAL RESULT:
The image should show the subject with exactly ONE physical trait dramatically exaggerated while all other features remain normal, with the enlarged feature completely replacing (not adding to) the original, seamlessly integrated and naturally lit to appear as if the subject was born with this unique proportion.`},{name:"EXPECTING?",category:["HUMOR","LIFE","TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a visibly pregnant person regardless of gender.

SUBJECT COUNT DETERMINATION (CRITICAL — FIRST STEP):
• First, determine how many human subjects are visible in the image
• All transformation logic must strictly follow the correct branch below

BRANCH A — SINGLE SUBJECT ONLY (HARD RULE):
• If ONLY ONE subject is visible:
  – That subject MUST be transformed into one of the grotesque 'normal' citizens of this world
  – The subject must NOT appear conventionally human
  – Do NOT introduce additional figures, silhouettes, or background characters
  – The world’s definition of 'normal' must be expressed solely through the subject’s grotesque features

BRANCH B — MULTIPLE SUBJECTS PRESENT:
• If MULTIPLE subjects are visible:
  – EXACTLY ONE subject must appear genuinely normal and conventionally human
  – ALL OTHER subjects must appear as the grotesque 'normal' citizens
  – The grotesque subjects must treat the human-looking subject as abnormal

DISGUST & GAZE INVERSION (MULTI-SUBJECT ONLY):
• Grotesque subjects must look at the human subject with disgust or moral judgment
• Body language should reinforce rejection and dominance
• The human subject should appear isolated or vulnerable

FACIAL TRANSFORMATION (GROTESQUE SUBJECTS):
• Distorted facial symmetry
• Heavy prosthetic-like features
• Flattened or exaggerated noses, uneven cheeks, misshapen mouths
• Features must resemble layered latex appliances — not monsters or fantasy creatures

FACIAL TREATMENT (TRULY NORMAL SUBJECT — MULTI-SUBJECT ONLY):
• Minimal or no distortion
• Clean, human proportions
• Lighting contrast used to emphasize social rejection

STYLE & MEDIUM:
• High-contrast black-and-white
• Film grain, soft focus, and 1960s television texture
• No color

LIGHTING & CAMERA:
• Stark shadows and oppressive, institutional lighting
• Dramatic angles reinforcing power imbalance

TONE:
• Serious, unsettling, restrained
• No humor, no parody

FINAL RESULT:
The final image must look like an authentic frame from a 1960s Twilight Zone episode. In single-subject images, the lone subject must appear as one of the grotesque 'normal' citizens. In multi-subject images, grotesque citizens must visibly judge and reject the lone human-looking subject. The logic branches must never overlap.`},{name:"FAIR RIDE",category:["CARNIVAL","AMUSEMENT","RIDE","FUN"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject riding a carnival or amusement park ride with dynamic action and excitement.

The viewer should think "That's [subject] as a fairy!" not "That's a generic fairy." The transformation adds magical elements without erasing the subject's identity - they remain themselves in a magical form.`},{name:"FAIRY HUMOR",category:["HUMOR","FANTASY","REALISM"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a fairy while preserving their identity and realism.

ABSOLUTE TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
• The subject MUST be a fairy
• The subject MUST have visible fairy wings
• The subject MUST be wearing a tutu

FAIRY DESIGN RULES:

• The tutu must fit the subject’s body correctly

GENDER HANDLING:

Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial identity in the Family Guy style.

The subject must be the main character, but include other Family Guy characters in the scene interacting naturally — they can be Griffin family members, neighbors, or recurring secondary characters.

Backgrounds should reflect typical Family Guy settings: living room, Quahog streets, Drunken Clam, or other show locations. Ensure proper perspective and consistency with the show’s signature look.

The final image should look like a fully integrated Family Guy world with the subject seamlessly placed among other characters, maintaining the show’s humor, proportions, and visual style.`},{name:"FALLOUT",category:["GAME","POSTAPOC","RETRO"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject directly into the Fallout video game world.

CHARACTER TYPE SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt suggests a character type, USE THAT CHARACTER TYPE
• If no character type is provided externally, SELECT EXACTLY ONE type using the RANDOM SEED
• This MUST be a true 50/50 random selection - flip a mental coin
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in an EVEN number (0,2,4,6,8): SELECT Vault Dweller
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in an ODD number (1,3,5,7,9): SELECT Ghoul
• Do not reuse the same type across renders
• This selection MUST occur before evaluating the subject's appearance
• Do NOT bias toward Ghoul for visual interest, detail, or drama
• Vault Dweller is NOT a fallback option
• VAULT DWELLER IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND ICONIC

If Vault Dweller:
• Dress the subject in an iconic bright blue-and-yellow Vault-Tec jumpsuit with visible vault number (Vault 101, 76, or 13)
• Equip a detailed Pip-Boy 3000 on left forearm with glowing green monochrome screen showing SPECIAL stats or map
• Style hair in clean 1950s retro cut - pompadour for men, victory rolls for women
• Place in iconic Vault location: vault door entrance with massive gear mechanism, vault cafeteria with propaganda posters, vault corridor with yellow and blue striping, or outside vault emerging into wasteland
• Include Vault-Tec branding, vintage computers with green screens, retro-futuristic technology
• Clean, heroic, adventurer aesthetic - the vault dweller is the PROTAGONIST
• Lighting: clean vault lighting with slight blue tint, or dramatic backlit vault door silhouette
• This is the ICONIC Fallout protagonist look - emphasize the retro-futuristic adventure hero aesthetic

If Ghoul:
• Severe radiation damage with leathery, cracked skin
• Collapsed nasal cartilage — the nose must be partially or completely missing, leaving a visible hole
• Exposed teeth, sunken eyes, asymmetrical facial damage
• Clothing is scavenged, pre-war, and deteriorated
• Subject must remain recognizable despite damage
• Place in post-apocalyptic wasteland: ruined buildings, irradiated zones, abandoned gas stations, or ghoul settlements
• Include radiation barrels, glowing debris, decrepit pre-war signage
• Weathered, survivor aesthetic with visible decay but determination

ENVIRONMENT & ART DIRECTION (CRITICAL):
• Must visually match Fallout game art — not generic post-apocalypse
• 1950s retro-futurism, satirical Americana, Vault-Tec propaganda
• Nuka-Cola branding, radiation barrels, Pip-Boy tech, weathered signage
• Color grading: greenish tint, high contrast, slight comic-book realism
• Lighting should feel stylized, not cinematic

The final image must be immediately recognizable as Fallout — not just a ruined world.`},{name:"FAMILY CREST",category:["HUMOR","HERALDRY","PORTRAIT"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and turn them into the centerpiece of a grand family crest or coat of arms.

Place the subject’s face in the center of a shield surrounded by decorative symbols, banners, and icons that humorously represent their personality, habits, or interests.

The crest should include ornate scrollwork, ribbons, and classic heraldic styling.

Use external master prompt text, if provided, to influence the motto, symbols, or family name.

The final image should look like a serious, medieval-style coat of arms, but with silly or absurd details that make it funny.`},{name:"FAMILY HOLIDAY PHOTO",category:["RETRO","HUMOR","PHOTOGRAPHY","FAMILY"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into an awkward family holiday photo from the late 1980s or early 1990s.

Select a holiday automatically at random (e.g., Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Halloween, Valentine’s Day, Fourth of July, New Year’s, or another widely recognized holiday), OR use a specific holiday provided via external master prompt.

The image should look like a staged holiday portrait taken with an on-camera flash: flat lighting, slight red-eye, soft focus, mild film grain, and dated color tones. The setting should feel like a living room or photo studio decorated for the chosen holiday.

Include classic, slightly tacky holiday decorations appropriate to the selected holiday. Decorations should feel excessive, mismatched, or unevenly arranged (e.g., too many balloons, awkward banners, cheap props, cluttered tables, or off-theme color combinations).

Dress all subjects in era-appropriate holiday clothing that clashes or feels uncomfortable. Examples include ugly sweaters, oversized cardigans, patterned vests, turtlenecks, stiff dresses, themed novelty outfits, or poorly coordinated formalwear. Hairstyles should be dated and awkward: big teased hair, perms, mullets, bowl cuts, feathered bangs, or obvious hairspray volume.

Subject logic:
• If there is ONE subject, surround them with added family members (parents, siblings, or relatives) who look mismatched or emotionally disconnected.
• If there are MULTIPLE subjects, present them as a family group standing or sitting closely together.

Body language should feel tense or unnatural: forced smiles, blank stares, crossed arms, stiff posture, uneven spacing, or someone clearly looking away from the camera. Not everyone should appear happy at the same time.

Optionally include a dated holiday banner, sign, or photo caption naming the holiday and year (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a plausible holiday label and year).

Ensure the entire photo is fully visible within the frame, like a complete printed holiday portrait. The final image should feel uncomfortably nostalgic, unintentionally funny, and instantly recognizable as an awkward family holiday photo — clearly readable on a small screen.`},{name:"FAR SIDE",category:["HUMOR","CARTOON","ABSURD","GARY LARSON"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject into a classic Far Side cartoon.

The final image must look like a full sheet of faxed paper viewed flat and fully visible within the frame, including margins, header, and body. Do not crop the page.

Apply classic fax artifacts: harsh black-and-white contrast, dithering, streaking scan lines, slight skew, uneven toner density, paper curl shadows, compression noise, and faint horizontal banding. The subject should appear embedded within the faxed image area and degraded but still identifiable.

At the top of the page, include a standard fax cover header with the following sections, all rendered in simple monospace or office-style fonts and visibly degraded:

• **From (Sender):** A humorous sender name, company, fax number, and phone number inspired by the subject’s appearance, clothing, posture, or environment (e.g., "Gary from Accounting," "Dept. of Snacks," "Fax: 555-0199").
• **To (Recipient):** A humorous recipient name, organization, and fax number, derived from scene context or absurd office logic.
• **Date:** A plausible transmission date (can be generic or stylized).
• **Subject / Re:** A short, funny description of the fax contents based on the subject or scene (e.g., "Urgent: Hat Situation," "Re: Chair Malfunction Update").
• **Pages:** Include a page count such as "1 of 1".

Below the header, include a **Confidentiality Notice** in small text, written humorously but styled like a real legal disclaimer (e.g., warning unintended recipients to destroy the fax immediately or consult a supervisor named something absurd).

All names, numbers, and text must be fictional, non-sensitive, and clearly comedic. If external master prompt text is provided, use it to override or guide sender, recipient, subject line, or tone.

Ensure the overall result unmistakably resembles a real faxed document rather than a modern filter. The page should feel outdated, bureaucratic, slightly ridiculous, and clearly readable on a small screen.`},{name:"FAZZINO POP ART",category:["ART","POP ART","LAYERED","3D","COLORFUL"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a vibrant 3D layered pop art composition with multiple raised paper-cut levels creating extreme visual depth at miniature scale.

Style characteristics: Ultra-bright saturated colors with bold black outlines, flat color fills with minimal shading, playful exaggerated proportions and perspectives. The aesthetic should resemble colorful painted cardstock or screen-printed paper sheets stacked at different heights, rendered with realistic miniature scale and physical dimensionality.

Layering structure: Divide the scene into at least 5-7 distinct depth levels with strong cast shadows between each layer emphasizing the sculptural three-dimensional quality.

CRITICAL - PACK THE SCENE WITH MINIATURES: Fill every inch of the composition with abundant miniature elements densely arranged: tiny buildings with architectural details, miniature cars and vehicles, small-scale people figures, street signs, storefronts, windows, decorative patterns, architectural ornaments, repeating shapes, whimsical embellishments, busy textures, trees, street lamps, and countless playful visual elements. The scene should feel like a bustling miniature cityscape or metropolitan diorama with an overwhelming joyful abundance of tiny detailed objects all bunched together. No empty space - every area should be filled with miniature sculptural elements.

The diorama MUST be constructed exclusively from elements present in the actual photographed scenery OR the location explicitly specified in the master prompt.

DO NOT invent a different city, skyline, or landmarks.

If the subject is in Miami, the diorama must reflect Miami.
If Las Vegas, Las Vegas.
If no location is provided, use ONLY the visible environment from the original image.

All buildings, streets, signage, vehicles, and scenery must be derived from the real environment and reinterpreted in layered, sculptural form.

The subject MUST appear as a FULL miniature human figure within the diorama — even if only a torso, head, or partial body was visible in the original photo.

The subject should be scaled down appropriately and integrated into the environment like a physical figurine.

Use layered depth, bright colors, paper-cut textures, stacked elements, and playful perspective.

The final image must look like a physical 3D pop-art diorama constructed from the real location — not a generic city illustration.

CRITICAL - SUBJECT SCALE: Transform the subject into a three-dimensional miniature figure within this densely packed layered diorama at the EXACT SAME SMALL SCALE as all other miniature elements. The subject must be proportionally sized to match the tiny buildings, miniature cars, and small people figures surrounding them - NOT larger or more prominent. If buildings are 2-3 inches tall in the miniature scene, the subject figure should be appropriately scaled (roughly 1 inch or smaller if representing a person). The subject should appear as ONE SMALL ELEMENT among many in the busy cityscape, not dominating the composition. They must have physical depth and dimension like a detailed figurine, integrated naturally among all other miniatures at consistent scale.

The final result should look like a physical framed miniature diorama or shadow box photographed straight-on, showcasing vibrant metropolitan energy with extreme visual depth, realistic three-dimensional construction, CONSISTENT miniature scale throughout with the subject properly sized to match all surrounding elements, overwhelming joyful abundance of densely packed tiny details, and clear dimensional separation between layers. Everything - including the subject - should appear as real miniature sculptural objects at the same small scale, bunched together in a busy, celebratory cityscape.`},{name:"FELT PUPPET",category:["TOY","PUPPET","CRAFTS"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into a felt puppet scene.

- Preserve subject's recognizable facial features while adapting them to 1960s style
- Integrate subject naturally as if they were always part of the group
- Capture the specific mood and energy of that particular photograph

Add visible injuries: a swollen black eye with dark purple bruising, a bloody nose with blood dripping or smeared on face, swollen or split lip, cuts and scrapes on face, reddened areas from impacts.

Clothing should be disheveled, torn, or stained with blood spots. Hair should be messy and out of place from the struggle.

The subject's expression should show exhaustion, defiance, toughness, or the aftermath of adrenaline - perhaps breathing heavily, grimacing, or showing a tough determined look despite the damage.

Optional context: Background could suggest where the fight occurred (alley, gym, street, parking lot), possibly with other visual clues of the altercation.

Keep all injuries photorealistic as if this is an actual photograph taken immediately after a fight. The damage should look fresh and recent with appropriate coloring for bruises (dark purple, red, swelling) and blood (realistic red, properly placed).

Design the image like an old carnival poster, with ornate borders, hand-painted lettering, and weathered paper texture.

Include a sensational headline and dramatic tagline describing the subject as a strange or amazing curiosity, using humorous or absurd flavor text.

If exactly one subject is detected, perform an inverse face transformation by subtly mirroring or inverting the subject’s facial features while preserving overall realism, expression, and identity. The result should feel intentionally uncanny but not distorted.

The subject should be captured at the exact peak moment of interaction, such as water spilling outward from a tipped glass, food launching into the air, or a dramatic splash as the subject jumps into a pool. Liquid, debris, or fragments should be frozen mid-air with sharp detail, dynamic shapes, and realistic physics while the subject remains crisply focused.

Render the subject simply, preserving only the most recognizable facial features, posture, or silhouette. Avoid overly detailed or three-dimensional features; the design should be believable as hand-piped or painted frosting.

Include realistic cake decorations such as frosting borders, small swirls, sprinkles, or minor fondant accents.

TRANSFORM THE SUBJECT:
• Subject MUST remain clearly recognizable
• This is NOT parody illustration — realistic staged photography
• Facial expression should subtly contradict the slogan

Preserve the subject’s recognizability while fully adapting them into the cartoon style.

Place the subject INTO an iconic Futurama environment and scene, selected based on context or randomly, such as:

• standing with Fry, Leela, and Bender in the Planet Express crew lineup
• walking through New New York with futuristic buildings and flying cars
• inside MomCorp, the Head Museum, or a sci-fi lab
• in a space scene with Futurama characters reacting to the subject

Existing Futurama characters may appear in the scene as supporting characters, background figures, or interaction partners, drawn accurately in their recognizable cartoon style. The subject should feel like a guest character naturally written into an episode, not pasted on top.

Adapt the subject’s clothing into Futurama-appropriate outfits — delivery uniforms, sci-fi jumpsuits, futuristic casual wear, or humorous future attire inspired by their real clothing.

Use simple painted backgrounds, clean animation lighting, and minimal texture consistent with hand-drawn cel animation. Avoid realistic shading or painterly effects.

Depict the subject as a story character fully integrated into a classic Grimm-style fairy tale scene, not as a modern person placed into an illustration. The subject may appear as a human, villager, traveler, child, noble, or fairy-tale creature as appropriate to the chosen story. The environment and supporting elements should clearly reflect a traditional fairy tale setting such as forests, cottages, castles, roads, or village scenes.

Render the image as a single illustrated storybook page. Ensure the entire page is fully visible within the frame, including margins, illustration, and text area. Do not crop or cut off any part of the page.

Present the subject as a small, inexpensive plastic toy figure with simplified proportions, glossy molded surfaces, visible seams, and limited articulation. The figure should clearly look like a real mass-produced kids’ meal toy — slightly stiff, charmingly cheap, and intentionally basic — not a cartoon illustration or realistic figurine.

The image MUST include a fully visible kids’ meal box in the frame. The box should be front-facing and unmistakable, with recognizable fast-food kids’ meal proportions (folded cardboard box with handle or clamshell shape). The toy should appear either:
• displayed in front of the box, or

NECK AREA TREATMENT (CRITICAL):
• Where the head should be (top of shoulders/neck) must be cleanly obscured
• Use theatrical methods to hide the neck opening:
  – High collar that covers where neck meets shoulders
  – Draped fabric, cloak, or scarf covering the shoulder/neck area
  – Shadow or darkness obscuring the top of the torso
  – Costume neckline that conceals the separation point
• The concealment must look intentional and theatrical
• DO NOT show raw neck stump, flesh, blood, or gore

POSE & COMPOSITION:

The final image should look like a normal photograph where one of three specific friendly Victorian-era ghosts (The Traveler with top hat and bag, The Skeleton with bowler hat, or The Old Man with cane) has quietly appeared beside the subject as if hitching a ride — translucent, glowing softly in cyan-blue, with a mischievous grin, charming and eerie but never frightening.`},{name:"HOARDERS",category:["HUMOR","TV","REALITY","MESSY"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a scene from the reality show 'Hoarders' with the subject surrounded by extreme clutter and accumulated items.

The subject should be standing or sitting in the middle of a severely cluttered room filled floor-to-ceiling with piles of stuff: stacks of newspapers and magazines, boxes overflowing with items, bags of belongings, old furniture piled up, random objects everywhere, narrow pathways through the clutter. The mess should be overwhelming and chaotic.

Items can be themed for humor: all garden gnomes, excessive craft supplies, thousands of fast food condiment packets, walls of VHS tapes, mountains of beanie babies, or traditional hoarding clutter. Make it densely packed and overwhelming.

The subject's expression should show they see nothing wrong with the situation - casual, defensive, or attached to their items. Clothing can be casual or slightly disheveled.

Lighting should match reality TV documentary style - natural indoor lighting, slightly dim, authentic and unglamorous. The scene should feel claustrophobic with limited space to move.

Optional elements: Concerned family member visible in background looking horrified, professional organizer or therapist trying to help, pets navigating through the clutter, visible dust or cobwebs adding to the neglected atmosphere.

The final image should look like an actual still from the Hoarders TV show - overwhelming clutter, reality TV documentary aesthetic, raw and authentic. The humor comes from the absurd amount of stuff and the subject's obliviousness to the extreme situation. Photorealistic with proper lighting and that specific reality TV look.`},{name:"HOLE-Y COSTUME",category:["HUMOR","COSTUME","NOVELTY","PHOTO OP"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject's face through a novelty costume hole, transforming them into an inanimate object.

Determine the subject’s astrological sign based on externally provided input or infer one arbitrarily if none is supplied. Clearly display the astrological sign name and symbol.

Write ONE short horoscope message based on the subject’s visible traits, expression, posture, clothing, or situation. The horoscope must be humorous, blunt, and confidently ridiculous — it should sound specific, obvious, and completely unserious.

Use flavor text to exaggerate mundane or trivial traits (e.g., procrastination, overconfidence, distraction, stubbornness) as if they are unavoidable cosmic truths. Avoid mystical language, poetic ambiguity, or generic fortune-cookie phrasing.

Include a clearly labeled "Lucky Number" that is intentionally useless, impractical, or meaningless (e.g., decimals, extremely large numbers, fractions, timestamps, negative numbers, or oddly specific values). The lucky number must not be applicable to gambling, dates, clocks, or real-world decisions.

Compose the image like a fake astrology card or newspaper horoscope box. Keep the layout clean, bold, and readable on a small screen. Ensure the full card, sign, horoscope text, and lucky number are fully visible.

Do not explain the joke. Do not add disclaimers. Treat the horoscope as completely accurate, no matter how absurd.`},{name:"HORROR FILMS",category:["HUMOR","MOVIES","SCENE","HORROR"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them into a scene from a classic horror film.

FILM SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt suggests a film, USE THAT FILM

  - 4: Psycho
  - 5: Halloween
  - 6: The Exorcist
  - 7: Texas Chainsaw Massacre
  - 8: Scream
  - 9: The Ring

The subject should be the central figure, reacting to the horror environment or villain in a dramatic or exaggerated way.

Lighting, perspective, and props should match the iconic horror style — dark shadows, eerie lighting, and creepy set pieces.

Optional master prompt text can add humorous twists (e.g., subject holding a comically oversized weapon, screaming dramatically, or unintentionally scaring the villain).

The final image should feel cinematic, instantly recognizable as a classic horror scene, and funny or absurd depending on the subject's pose or expression.`},{name:"I'M HUNGRY",category:["FOOD","TRANSFORMATION","MASTER PROMPT"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a figure entirely made out of real, non-candy food items (vegetables, fruits, grains, bread, pasta, cheese, etc.).

Avoid candy or chocolate elements.

Place the food figure in a simple, neutral background such as a kitchen counter, plate, or wooden surface, with natural lighting and subtle shadows to make it appear tangible and realistic. Ensure the entire subject is fully visible.

Add playful flavor text to the scene automatically based on the subject, like 'Dinner is served!' or 'Eat your vegetables!' or allow the user to append a custom message via master prompt.

The final image should feel whimsical, absurd, humorous, and clearly readable on small screens, emphasizing the creativity of using ordinary food items to replicate the subject.`},{name:"I'M WITH STOOPID",category:["HUMOR","TEXT","SHIRT"],message:`Take a picture and transform it so one subject appears to be wearing an 'I'm with Stoopid' t-shirt that looks physically printed on the fabric, not digitally overlaid.

If only one subject is detected, display the text 'I'm with Stoopid' with a single large arrow pointing upward toward the wearer’s own head.

If two or more subjects are detected, place the shirt on the primary subject and display the text 'I'm with Stoopid' with one or more arrows pointing sideways or diagonally toward the other visible subjects. Arrows should clearly indicate the other subjects without overlapping faces.

Ensure the text and arrows remain bold, high-contrast, and legible on small screens while maintaining a believable printed-shirt appearance.

• Do NOT display text or explain the idiom

SUBJECT RULES:
• The subject must be directly involved in the literal scenario

OPTION 1 - VISIBLE BOOGERS: The subject is completely unaware they have visible nasal discharge (boogers) hanging from or under their nose. Add realistic mucus visible at the nostrils - it could be hanging, crusty, or dripping slightly. The subject's expression must show they are completely oblivious - looking normal, happy, confident, or engaged in conversation. They think everything is fine, making the situation more awkward and humorous.

OPTION 2 - NOSE PICKING: The subject is actively picking their nose with their finger inserted into their nostril. They are completely absorbed in the act, unaware they're being photographed. The finger should be realistically positioned in the nose with appropriate hand placement. Their expression should show concentration or absent-minded focus on the task. This could be in a public setting, during a meeting, in a car, or any situation where nose-picking would be particularly inappropriate.

For both options: Include optional context that makes it worse - professional setting (meeting, presentation, date, interview), talking to someone, or what they think is a nice photo opportunity.

Keep lighting and photography photorealistic. The humor comes from either the subject's obliviousness to the visible boogers OR being caught in the act of nose-picking.

Preserve recognizable facial features while adding the unfortunate nasal situation.`},{name:"IGOR",category:["CLASSIC FILM","COMEDY","EXAGGERATED","CHARACTER"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a full comedic homage to Igor from *Young Frankenstein*, embracing exaggerated, over-the-top Mel Brooks–style physical comedy.

CORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):
• The transformation is intentionally extreme and funny
• The subject remains human, not monstrous
• The humor must read instantly, even at a glance

EYE TRANSFORMATION (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
• BOTH eyes must remain present
• Eyes must be dramatically bulging and protruding
• One eye must bulge more than the other
• Eyes may point in slightly different directions
• Large areas of visible sclera (eye whites)
• Eyelids stretched wide in an unblinking stare
• Eye placement must feel ridiculous but still attached to the face

FACIAL SUPPORTING FEATURES:
• Eyebrows raised unevenly to enhance asymmetry
• Subtle cheek tension or jaw slackness
• Mouth slightly open or lopsided, suggesting clueless enthusiasm

STRICT PROHIBITIONS:
• NO extra eyes
• NO removal of eyes
• NO glowing, fantasy colors, or supernatural effects
• NO scars, bolts, stitches, or monster makeup
• NO hunchbacks or body deformation

COMEDY & REALISM BALANCE:
• The face may stretch or compress slightly to support the gag
• Skin texture must remain realistic
• Lighting and shadows must match the original photo
• The image should still resemble a real photograph

SUBJECT BEHAVIOR:
• Expression conveys cheerful confusion or eager obedience
• The subject appears unaware of how absurd they look
• No deliberate mugging for the camera

STYLE:
• Photorealistic with exaggerated expression
• No cartoon rendering
• No illustration or animation style

TONE:
• Broad physical comedy

The subject should be seated, looking shocked, defensive, emotional, or in denial. Surround them with concerned family members and friends sitting in a semicircle, all looking serious and worried. Include an intervention specialist or counselor present.

Setting should be a modest living room or community center room with folding chairs arranged in intervention style. Lighting should match reality TV documentary style - slightly dim, handheld camera aesthetic, authentic and raw.

The aesthetic should match reality TV confessional style with that specific documentary lighting and framing. Optional: Include text overlay at bottom like reality shows use - 'Day 1 of Intervention' or subject's name and their 'problem.'

Depth must be represented only through isometric extrusion, vertical offsets, overlap, and stacking — not through blur, bokeh, or atmospheric effects.

Use consistent lighting and shading across all surfaces to reinforce form and depth. Shadows should be crisp, directional, and uniform, matching the isometric angle.

Surface detail should be simplified or removed. Avoid photographic textures, skin pores, fabric weave, or noise. Favor smooth, stylized surfaces suitable for a game map, architectural diagram, or technical illustration.

Use Kubrick's distinctive visual style: perfectly symmetrical one-point perspective composition, stark geometric framing, dramatic lighting with strong contrast, and meticulous attention to detail. The subject should be centered in the frame with symmetrical elements on both sides. Use Kubrick's characteristic wide-angle lens look, slow deliberate camera movement aesthetic, and painterly color palette from the selected film.

• A reflection
• A printed image
• A floating face
• A submerged object
• A picture inside the cup

DO NOT paste or place the subject into the drink.
DO NOT insert a photo into liquid.
DO NOT treat the coffee surface as a screen.

Do NOT render realistic human heads, sculpted hair, or detailed facial geometry. Any hairstyle or head covering must appear only as a separate LEGO accessory piece (helmet, hat, hair piece), not as part of the head itself.

Translate the subject’s recognizable traits into simplified LEGO-style printed facial graphics while maintaining the iconic LEGO look.

Encode the subject’s shape and depth into a repeating patterned texture so the image appears abstract at first glance but reveals the subject when viewed with relaxed or unfocused eyes.

Use a dense, repeating pattern with subtle depth cues that form the subject’s silhouette and major features in three dimensions. Do not include outlines, labels, or hints. The subject should not be immediately obvious without proper viewing.

Ensure the pattern is clean, evenly tiled, and centered. The final image should resemble a classic Magic Eye print that is visually stable and readable on a small screen.`},{name:"MAGICIAN FAIL",category:["HUMOR","MAGIC","ILLUSION","DISASTER"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and transform them into a stage magician during a deliberately staged magic illusion that is going humorously wrong.

IMPORTANT SAFETY CONTEXT:
• This is a theatrical magic performance
• No real injury, harm, or danger is occurring
• All failures are clearly illusion-based and harmless

The subject wears classic magician attire such as a tuxedo, cape, vest, or top hat.

Examples of comedic illusion failures include:

• A levitation trick where harmless stage supports are plainly visible
• A rabbit escaping the hat while the magician reacts in disbelief
• A disappearing act where only a costume piece vanishes

The failure must be unmistakable but clearly non-dangerous and played for comedy.

Include humorous visual cues such as:
• Overacted panic or embarrassment
• Assistants reacting dramatically but unharmed
• Audience laughing or gasping theatrically

Lighting, stage props, curtains, and spotlights should match a live stage performance.

The final image should look like a staged performance photograph capturing a slapstick moment of illusion failure — exaggerated, absurd, and clearly safe.`},{name:"MAGNUM CONTACT SHEET",category:["PHOTOGRAPHY","DOCUMENTARY","JOURNALISM","CONTACT SHEET"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a Magnum Photos–style contact sheet from a documentary photo shoot.

The mascot must appear as a physical, wearable suit with a large oversized mascot head, visible seams, plush or foam textures, and costume proportions typical of real stadium mascots.

Preserve the subject’s recognizable traits by translating facial characteristics into the mascot head design, not by using the real face. Eyes, mouth, and expression should be part of the costume head.

Use photoreal lighting and materials so the mascot looks like a real person wearing a professional mascot suit, not a cartoon or illustration. Place the mascot in a stadium, field, or arena environment.

Ensure the full mascot body is visible and properly proportioned. The final image should look like a real sports mascot photographed during a live event.`},{name:"MATRIMONY",category:["HUMOR","CEREMONY","PORTRAIT","SCENE TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture and transform the image into a wedding ceremony scene set at the altar, moments before saying 'I do.'

SUBJECT RECOGNITION (THROUGH DEFORMATION):
• Identity preserved through distorted facial geometry
• Eyes, nose, and mouth recognizable but sagging, stretched, or sliding
• Recognition comes from shape and proportion, not intact skin
• The subject is mid-collapse, not intact

GEOMETRIC DEFORMATION (MANDATORY):
• Facial features physically elongate and droop
• Nose stretches downward
• Cheeks slide and sag
• Mouth warps and drips
• Jawline loses rigidity
• Head partially collapsing under its own weight
• Body mass flowing downward continuously

MELTING PHYSICS:
• Gravity-driven liquefaction
• Upper regions partially intact, lower regions heavily deformed
• Continuous flow — not frozen drips
• Material stretches, thins, and breaks into streams
• Portions of the subject separating and falling
• A growing puddle at the base made of the SAME material as the subject

CLOTHING & ACCESSORIES:
• Clothing does NOT remain intact
• Clothing melts into the same material as the body
• Fabric becomes liquid, fused, warped
• No recognizable fabric texture unless melted into material form

The sculpture should have an industrial, contemporary art feel with bold geometric shapes, flowing curves, and dynamic angles that suggest the subject's form and pose without literal representation. Include negative space and cutouts within the metal structure. Show the sculptural mass as solid, heavy metalwork with thickness and weight.

Surfaces should display authentic metal textures: brushed finish with directional grain, rust patina with orange and brown oxidation, verdigris green copper aging, polished reflective sections, and rough hammered areas. Include realistic weathering, scratches, and industrial fabrication marks.

Place the sculpture in an appropriate setting: museum gallery with spotlights, outdoor plaza, sculpture garden, or contemporary art space. Use dramatic lighting that creates strong highlights on polished metal surfaces and deep shadows in recesses. Show metal's reflective properties catching light.

The sculpture should be clearly recognizable as the subject through its overall form, proportions, and gesture, but rendered as an abstract modernist metalwork piece - an artistic interpretation rather than realistic statue.

Render the subject in a Mike Judge–style character design: slightly awkward proportions, stiff posture, minimal facial expression, uneven line work, flat cel-shaded colors, and intentionally plain or unflattering details. Preserve the subject’s recognizability while adapting them fully into the cartoon style.

Place the subject INTO a recognizable Mike Judge cartoon scene, selected based on context or randomly. The scene should clearly reflect one of the following shows and environments, and may include recognizable characters from that show:

• King of the Hill — suburban Arlen, Texas (backyard fence chats, alleyways, living rooms, Strickland Propane). Characters may include Hank Hill, Peggy, Bobby, Dale, Bill, or Boomhauer.
• Beavis and Butt-Head — grimy neighborhood streets, living room couch, fast-food joints, school hallways. Characters may include Beavis, Butt-Head, or classmates reacting to the subject.
• Daria — school hallways, classrooms, coffee shops, or suburban interiors. Characters may include Daria, Jane, Quinn, or classmates observing the subject.
• Office Space–style environment — dull corporate office, cubicle farms, break rooms, printer destruction areas. Characters may include bored coworkers or management-style figures inspired by the film’s tone.

Existing characters should appear as supporting or background characters interacting with or reacting to the subject. The subject should feel like a guest character awkwardly dropped into the episode, not replacing anyone.

Adapt the subject’s clothing into simplified everyday outfits typical of Mike Judge cartoons — plain t-shirts, polos, jeans, boring office attire, or aggressively normal suburban clothing.

Use muted, slightly washed-out color palettes, flat lighting, and simple painted backgrounds. Avoid exaggerated animation, flashy effects, or glossy textures.

Ensure the full scene is visible and readable on a small screen, with the subject clearly identifiable among the characters.

Show the subject frozen in an exaggerated mime pose - pretending to be trapped in an invisible box with hands pressed against imaginary glass walls, pulling an invisible rope, walking against invisible wind, or climbing invisible stairs. Their facial expression should be theatrical and over-dramatic. Place them in a street performance setting - cobblestone plaza, Parisian street scene, or park with small crowd watching. Include mime props if appropriate - invisible wall, trapped in box gesture, leaning on nothing. Use dramatic lighting and slight vignette for theatrical effect. The performance should be clearly pantomime with exaggerated physical comedy frozen mid-gesture.

Scale all subjects and objects to match the proportions of a physical miniature set, so they appear small and in proportion to each other. Render surfaces with handcrafted textures such as clay, painted wood, cardboard, fabric, or tiny props, giving the scene a realistic, tactile feel.

Use shallow depth of field, soft studio lighting, and subtle shadows to emulate macro photography of a real miniature model.

  - 2: Furniture scaled incorrectly (tiny couch or massive table)
  - 3: Food item wildly mis-scaled (giant grape, tiny pizza slice)
  - 4: Tool or appliance mis-scaled (huge remote, tiny ladder)
  - 5: Environmental object mis-scaled (oversized mailbox, miniature tree)

SCALE RULES:
• EXACTLY ONE object may have incorrect scale
• The object must remain realistic in material and detail
• No cartoon exaggeration or stylization
• Perspective must support the illusion

SUBJECT RULES:
• Subject remains normal-sized and recognizable

Replace the Mona Lisa’s face with the subject, carefully adapting their facial features, expression, and posture to match the iconic pose, angle, and calm demeanor of the original artwork. The subject should feel painted into the scene, not pasted on.

Render the image in a classical Renaissance oil painting style with soft brushwork, subtle gradients, muted earth tones, and realistic canvas texture. Preserve the iconic background landscape, atmospheric depth, and lighting.

Gently adapt the subject’s hair or accessories into period-appropriate forms while maintaining recognizable traits (for example, modern glasses subtly reinterpreted as period-style frames).

Ensure the full painting is visible within the frame, including the subject, background, and edges of the artwork. The final image should feel like a museum-worthy reinterpretation — respectful, believable, and quietly humorous through contrast.`},{name:"MONDRIAN",category:["ART","GEOMETRIC","ARTIST","ABSTRACT"],message:"Take a picture and reinterpret it in the style of Piet Mondrian.

Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features, body proportions, clothing identity, and personality. Match the exact cinematography of the chosen movie including lens type, depth of field, film grain, color grading, lighting direction, production design, and era-accurate costuming if required. The subject must appear physically present in the scene with correct scale, shadows, reflections, and environmental interaction. The background, props, and atmosphere must be authentic to the movie’s world, making the subject indistinguishable from the original cast and fully integrated into the scene."},{name:"MOVIE SET REALITY",category:["CINEMA","META","CREATIVE"],message:"Take a picture and create the scene as a movie set rather than real life. The subject remains realistic and unchanged, but the environment is exposed as a film production: buildings are partially constructed facades, walls end abruptly, lighting rigs, boom mics, cameras, and crew are subtly visible. The sky is a painted or printed backdrop held by scaffolding, scenery is mounted on trusses, and distant landscapes are clearly artificial. Floor markings, cables, and set props are visible. Cinematic lighting, behind-the-scenes realism, playful but believable illusion."},{name:"MR. POTATO HEAD",category:["TOY","RETRO","POTATO"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a Mr. Potato Head–style toy.

Convert the subject into a smooth, potato-shaped plastic body with a slightly shiny, molded toy texture. The subject’s original human facial anatomy MUST NOT remain visible. All facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears, eyebrows) must be represented ONLY as removable Mr. Potato Head–style toy parts.

Important facial replacement rules:
• REMOVE the subject’s real nose, mouth, eyes, and ears entirely
• REPLACE them with toy-style plug-in parts mounted directly onto the potato surface
• Do NOT allow any human facial features to appear behind or beneath the toy parts
• Ensure correct positioning: the toy nose must sit centered above the toy mouth, with clear separation between parts

Arrange classic Mr. Potato Head components — eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, ears, arms, and optional accessories (hat, glasses, mustache) — snapped into visible peg holes or implied mounting points. Parts should feel modular, slightly misaligned, and intentionally toy-like, but never overlapping or duplicated.

Preserve the subject’s identity through:
• eye shape or spacing translated into toy eyes
• mouth expression adapted into a toy mouth
• accessories inspired by the subject (glasses, hat, etc.)

Maintain realistic toy scale, lighting, and soft shadows so the figure appears as a real physical plastic toy photographed in the real world.

Avoid cartoon drawing styles or painterly rendering. This must look like a tangible Mr. Potato Head toy, not an illustration.

Keep the composition clean and centered. Ensure the full toy is visible and clearly readable on small screens.

Background and framing: Place the subject against a height measurement wall with clear horizontal lines and markers. Use a neutral institutional backdrop. Camera angle should be straight-on with the subject facing forward in standard mugshot style.

Placard details: The subject holds a board displaying a whimsical ID number and date. Generate humorous or descriptive fictional text inspired by the subject's expression, clothing, or personality (examples: 'Stand-up Philosopher', 'Professional Procrastinator', 'Serial Cereal Eater'). Incorporate any externally provided master prompt text naturally.

Subject appearance: Hair, clothing, and expression may show slight comedic dishevelment or exaggerated personality traits. Expressions can be deadpan, silly, smirking, or exaggeratedly dramatic.

Lighting and quality: Use flat, institutional-style lighting typical of official ID photos, emphasizing facial features and photorealistic depth. Subtle imperfections (slight shadows, mild unevenness) may be included for realism.

The final image should look exactly like a genuine police-style booking photograph, preserving the subject's recognizable face, pose, and expression, but entirely safe, humorous, and fictional.`},{name:"MULTIPLE MATERIALS",category:["SURREAL","TEXTURE","PHOTOREALISTIC","TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject so that different parts of their body appear as distinct materials.

Create several copies of the subject, each placed naturally into the environment with consistent lighting, scale, and perspective. The duplicates should feel like they coexist in the same moment rather than layered edits.

Each version of the subject should have a slightly different pose, expression, or attitude to suggest personality divergence — for example: confident, confused, bored, overexcited, distracted, or plotting.

Avoid obvious repetition. Vary posture, head tilt, facial expression, or interaction with the environment so each duplicate feels intentional.

Keep the composition readable on a small screen. Ensure no duplicate is cropped or partially hidden.

The subject should be actively participating in the musical moment — dancing, singing, or dramatically posing — while fully integrated into the scene with background dancers, instruments, or choreography.

Costumes, props, lighting, and setting should match the original musical style and era.

Optional flavor text from the master prompt can influence the song, scene, or humorous twist (e.g., the subject missing a step, dramatically belting a line, or accidentally knocking over props).

• Near or holding the state bird or animal (photorealistic, integrated naturally)
• With a famous state monument visible in background
• State flag prominently displayed nearby (on building, flagpole, or held)

STATE MOTTO:
• Add the state's official motto as a small banner/footer in the image
• Styled as vintage americana typography or state seal style
• Readable but not overwhelming the main image

STYLE:
• Photorealistic
• Americana aesthetic - patriotic, proud, celebratory
• Natural lighting appropriate to location
• Subject appears as enthusiastic tourist or proud resident

FINAL RESULT:
The image should look like a vintage travel postcard or state tourism advertisement featuring the subject celebrating that specific state's most iconic elements.`},{name:"NIGHTHAWKS",category:["ART","PAINTING","AMERICAN REALISM","HISTORICAL"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into the style of Edward Hopper’s painting Nighthawks (1942).

CORE REQUIREMENT:
The subject must REPLACE one of the human figures inside the diner without removing or cropping the rest of the scene.

POSITION LOCK (CRITICAL FIX):
• The subject MUST be located INSIDE the diner interior, behind the glass
• The subject may NOT appear on the sidewalk, street, exterior reflection, or outside the diner
• The subject must occupy the exact spatial position of an original interior figure

SUBJECT INTEGRATION:
• The subject becomes one diner patron or the bartender.
• Preserve Hopper’s original body pose, posture, and placement for that figure.
• Replace only the face (and optionally subtle hands/arms if visible) with the subject’s likeness, adapted to Hopper’s painted anatomy.
• The subject must feel emotionally detached, distant, or introspective.
• Keep the subject naturally integrated, proportionally scaled, and visually coherent with the rest of the figures and environment.

SCENE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):
• Maintain the full diner interior, including all other patrons, the bartender, furniture, counters, stools, and décor.
• Preserve the exterior street, sidewalk, and urban emptiness visible through the windows.
• Keep all original compositions, geometry, and placement of characters and objects.
• Do NOT remove, crop, or replace any other elements aside from the single figure chosen for substitution.

STYLE & MEDIUM:
• Oil painting on canvas.
• Smooth but visible brushwork.
• Muted, controlled color palette.
• No photographic realism.
• No cartoon stylization.

LIGHTING (CRITICAL):
• Strong interior fluorescent diner light.
• Exterior street remains dark, empty, and quiet.
• Sharp contrast between interior warmth and exterior isolation.

COMPOSITION RULES:
• Preserve the original Nighthawks layout:
 – Corner diner.
 – Large glass windows.
 – Empty street.
• No additional people.
• No modern objects.

EMOTIONAL TONE:
• Loneliness.
• Stillness.
• Urban isolation.
• Suspended time.

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
• Do NOT modernize the scene.
• Do NOT add extra figures.
• Do NOT exaggerate expressions.
• Do NOT break Hopper’s geometry.

FINAL RESULT:
The image must look like a faithful Hopper oil painting where the subject appears as if they were always part of Nighthawks — quiet, distant, and frozen in time — while the rest of the diner and exterior remain fully intact, unaltered, and visually consistent.`},{name:"NIGHT VISION",category:["PHOTOGRAPHY","GREEN","MILITARY"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into night vision style. Green monochrome, sensor noise."},{name:"NOT IT!",category:["HUMOR","SOCIAL","PHOTO EFFECT"],message:`Take a picture and transform the scene so it appears the subjects are playing the classic game of "Not It."

Analyze the number of visible subjects:
• If multiple subjects are present, show all but one touching their index finger to their nose in a synchronized, quick-reaction pose.
• One subject should clearly be "too late" — their finger either not yet touching their nose, hovering just short, or their hand still moving — making it obvious they are now "it."

Body language and facial expressions are critical:
• The non-it subjects should look relieved, smug, amused, or triumphant.
• The subject who is "it" should look surprised, annoyed, resigned, or caught off-guard.

Ensure everyone remains in the same moment in time, as if the action was frozen immediately after the call of "Not it!" No motion blur — clarity is more important than realism.

Do not add text, arrows, or labels. The concept must be communicated purely through pose, gesture, and expression.

Match lighting, perspective, and scale so the scene feels like a candid photo capturing a spontaneous social moment. Keep the composition readable on a small screen, with all hands and faces clearly visible.`},{name:"NURSERY RHYME STORYBOOK",category:["STORYBOOK","KIDS","LESSON"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into the main character of a classic nursery rhyme. Select the nursery rhyme based on the subject’s appearance, personality, posture, environment, or externally provided instructions.

Examples include, but are not limited to: Jack and Jill (subject as Jack or Jill), Little Miss Muffet (subject as Miss Muffet), Mary Had a Little Lamb (subject as Mary), Humpty Dumpty (subject fully transformed into Humpty), Old MacDonald Had a Farm (subject as Old MacDonald), Row Row Row Your Boat (subject rowing the boat), Jack Be Nimble (subject as Jack), Little Bo Peep (subject as Bo Peep), Little Boy Blue (subject as Little Boy Blue), or similar well-known rhymes.

Transform the subject accordingly so they appear fully integrated into the nursery rhyme world — not posing on top of it. Costumes, props, environment, and proportions should make the subject look like they belong inside the story.

Render the scene in a whimsical, illustrated storybook style with soft colors, painterly textures, gentle lighting, and classic children’s book charm. Avoid modern objects or settings unless intentionally playful.

Include the **title of the nursery rhyme** prominently and clearly at the top or bottom of the image. Display a **short, complete version of the nursery rhyme text** within the scene in large, legible lettering, styled like a storybook page. All text must be fully visible and readable.

The final image should resemble a single open illustrated page from a nursery rhyme book, with the subject and all text fully contained within the frame, suitable for viewing on a small screen. The tone should be magical, nostalgic, and immediately recognizable.`},{name:"NUTCRACKER",category:["HUMOR","TRANSFORMATION","OBJECT","HOLIDAY"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and transform them into a classic wooden nutcracker figure.

Wood grain, paint wear, chips, and glossy varnish should be visible.

The mouth should appear hinged or mechanical, clearly identifying the figure as a nutcracker.

DO NOT make the subject look like a person in costume.

The final image must look like a real physical nutcracker figurine displayed upright.`},{name:"O’KEEFFE",category:["ART","PAINTING","ARTIST","ORGANIC"],message:"Take a picture and reinterpret it in the style of Georgia O’Keeffe.

First, determine what object best represents the subject based on their appearance, clothing, or context. The subject becomes that object while retaining their characteristics - their clothing colors/patterns become the object's colors and surface design, any text or logos on their outfit appear as labels or markings on the object, their facial expression translates to the object's 'face' (using natural features of that object type), their body proportions determine the object's shape and size. The entire environment must also be constructed from the same type of object - if subject becomes a car, the world is all cars; if a book, everything is books; if a bottle, all bottles; if furniture, all furniture pieces. Buildings, trees, ground, sky, other people - everything transforms into creative arrangements of that one object type. The objects should have personality and life while remaining recognizable as that object. Use photorealistic rendering with authentic material textures - metal, plastic, wood, glass, fabric depending on object type.

SUBJECT COUNT LOGIC (CRITICAL):
• If TWO subjects are visible:
  – Create ONE child
  – The child’s facial features MUST be a blended combination of BOTH subjects
  – Blend bone structure, eye shape, nose, mouth, and skin tone naturally
  – The result should look like a believable biological child of the two subjects

• If ONLY ONE subject is visible:
  – Transform the subject into a child version of themselves
  – Randomize the child’s sex
  – Randomize the child’s race
  – The result must still feel genetically plausible and human

CHILD AGE RANGE:
• The child must appear between 4 and 8 years old
• Proportions must reflect a real child (larger eyes, softer facial features)

REALISM RULES (CRITICAL):
• Photographic realism
• No cartoon, anime, or stylized rendering
• Natural skin texture and lighting
• No exaggerated or fantasy traits

SAFETY & CONTENT RULES:
• The child must be fully clothed
• Clothing must be age-appropriate and neutral
• No adult themes, poses, or expressions
• Innocent, neutral, or gentle expression only

BACKGROUND HANDLING:
• If possible, keep the original background
• Otherwise, use a simple, realistic environment (studio or everyday setting)

IDENTITY RULES:
• Do NOT add accessories that were not already present unless necessary for realism
• Do NOT add makeup
• Do NOT sexualize or dramatize the subject

FINAL RESULT:
The final image must look like a real photograph of a child — either the believable offspring of two subjects, or a randomized child version of a single subject — natural, respectful, and emotionally neutral.`},{name:"OLD MACDONALD HAD A FARM",category:["HUMOR","FARM","ANIMALS","TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and create a photorealistic farm animal whose ORIGINAL ANIMAL HEAD DOES NOT EXIST.

FARM ANIMAL SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt suggests a farm animal, USE THAT FARM ANIMAL
• If no farm animal is provided externally, SELECT EXACTLY ONE farm animal using the RANDOM SEED
• Use the LAST DIGIT of the RANDOM SEED:
  - 0: horse
  - 1: pig
  - 2: cow
  - 3: sheep
  - 4: goat
  - 5: chicken
  - 6: rooster
  - 7: duck
  - 8: goose
  - 9: rabbit

COMPLETELY REMOVE THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND SKULL. The animal's original face, snout, beak, eyes, and mouth must NOT be visible anywhere.

Replace the animal's entire head with the subject's full human head — not just the face. The human head must be fully three-dimensional, volumetric, and anatomically attached to the animal's neck as if it naturally grew there.

The subject's human head must:
• Replace the animal's head entirely
• Be correctly scaled to the animal's body
• Connect seamlessly at the neck with realistic anatomy, skin transitions, fur/feather blending, and shadowing
• Match the animal's head orientation, posture, and perspective

DO NOT:
• Paste, overlay, mask, or superimpose a photo
• Leave any part of the animal's original head visible
• Place a human face on top of an animal face
• Create a collage or cutout effect

Optional animal features (ears, horns, wool, feathers) may appear BEHIND or AROUND the human head if anatomically plausible, but the animal's face itself must be entirely gone.

The creature should be performing a normal farm activity (grazing, standing in a stall, pecking the ground, chewing cud, waddling, etc.) in a realistic farm environment such as a pasture, barn, coop, or muddy yard.

Lighting must be natural and consistent across the entire body and head.

The final result must look like a real photograph of a farm animal that somehow biologically evolved with a human head instead of an animal head — disturbing, absurd, and realistic, not edited or pasted.`},{name:"OLYMPIAN",category:["SPORTS","OLYMPICS","VICTORY","ATHLETIC"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject on the Olympic medal podium celebrating a victory.

• Platform-accurate layout and tone
• Product title describing the subject humorously but deadpan
• Bullet-point feature list describing personality traits, habits, or quirks
• Include a product rating (e.g. ★★★☆☆, ★★★★★, etc.) with review count
• Include a price — either absurdly cheap or ridiculously expensive
• Include availability status (In Stock, Limited Stock, Only 1 Left, etc.)
• Include Prime / Buy Now / Add to Cart style UI depending on platform
• Include subtle platform-specific visual cues (buttons, badges, icons)

PLATFORM BEHAVIOR DETAILS:
• Amazon / Walmart / Target: clean corporate listing, Prime-style shipping badges
• eBay / Facebook Marketplace: casual seller tone, slightly chaotic description
• Etsy: handcrafted, emotional, overly sincere description
• Temu: suspiciously cheap price, exaggerated claims
• Newegg / Best Buy: technical specs listed even if meaningless
• Wayfair: elegant staging, oddly specific dimensions

SETTING & COMPOSITION:
• Subject photographed like a product
• Neutral or lifestyle background depending on platform
• Full-body product view preferred
• FULL image visible with all four corners present
• No cropping of subject or UI elements

STYLE:
• Ultra-realistic e-commerce photography
• Looks indistinguishable from a real listing screenshot
• Humor comes from accuracy and commitment
• No memes, no visual jokes, no exaggeration

FINAL RESULT:
The image should convincingly resemble a real online marketplace listing where the subject is the product being sold — complete with platform-accurate UI, pricing, ratings, and flavor text — subtle, dry, and uncomfortably believable, with the subject fully visible from head to toe.`},{name:"OOMPA LOOMPA",category:["MOVIES","FANTASY","CANDY","CLASSIC","TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into an Oompa Loompa character from the classic film, placing them in an iconic factory scene.

Transform the subject's appearance: reduce height to small stature, apply orange-tinted skin tone, style hair in distinctive manner (often green or unusual color), dress in white overalls with brown trim and shirt, knee-high socks, and black shoes. Preserve recognizable facial features while adapting to the distinctive look.

FACTORY LOCATION SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt suggests a factory location, USE THAT FACTORY LOCATION
• If no factory location is provided externally, SELECT EXACTLY ONE factory location using the RANDOM SEED
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 0,1: SELECT chocolate waterfall and river area with candy mushrooms and edible landscape
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 2,3: SELECT golden egg room with geese
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 4: SELECT inventing room with experimental candy machines
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 5,6: SELECT television chocolate room with equipment
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 7: SELECT candy forest with lollipop trees
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 8: SELECT nut sorting room
• If the RANDOM SEED ends in 9: SELECT fizzy lifting drinks room

Place the subject in the selected famous factory location. Surround the subject with other Oompa Loompas working in the factory or preparing to perform, all with matching appearance and costumes. Include the fantastical candy factory environment with vibrant colors, impossible proportions, whimsical industrial equipment, massive candy productions, and magical chocolate-making machinery.

The setting should capture the dreamlike quality of the factory: oversized candy elements, colorful pipes and machinery, sugar crystals, chocolate rivers, candy plants, lollipop trees, or other fantastical sweet-themed environmental details.

Lighting should have that slightly surreal, colorful quality of the original film - warm glowing light, candy-colored illumination, and the magical atmosphere of the factory.

Optional: Position subject as if about to perform or mid-performance of their famous moralizing musical number, with other Oompa Loompas in coordinated poses.

The final image should look like an actual still from the classic film - whimsical, colorful, slightly surreal, with the subject fully transformed and integrated into the magical candy factory world. Capture the fantastical, slightly uncanny charm of the original movie's aesthetic.`},{name:"OPERATION",category:["HUMOR","GAME","PARODY","DESIGN"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into the board-game Operation.

The final image must show the **entire game board fully visible** within the frame, viewed from above like a real tabletop game. Do not crop any part of the board.

Use a familiar Operation-style layout: a human body diagram with outlined cavities, exaggerated organs, bright colors, and clean, bold shapes. Replace the traditional game head with the subject’s head, adapted into a flat, illustrated style that matches the board aesthetic while remaining recognizable.

Integrate humorous, fictional items into the body cavities inspired by the subject’s traits or environment (e.g., snacks, phone, keys, coffee cup, tangled thoughts). Items should be cartoonish and clearly readable.

Include parody game elements such as:
• Stylized cavity outlines
• Plastic-board textures
• Simplified medical tools (tweezers, wires) as decorative elements
• Playful warning lights or buzz indicators (visual only, no text required)

This must be a humorous, original parody inspired by the classic game format.

Ensure colors are bold, shapes are clean, and all elements are readable on a small screen. The final image should feel like a ridiculous but believable board game someone could actually play.`},{name:"OPPOSITE SELF",category:["TRANSFORMATION","OPPOSITE","SWAP"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into their opposite self while preserving the subject’s recognizable facial structure, expressions, posture, and identity.

The subject’s body, clothing, and features must be constructed entirely from folded paper, with realistic creases, folds, layers, and shadows. No textures or elements from the original photo may remain.

The environment around the subject must also be made entirely of folded paper, including furniture, objects, or scenery.

Lighting and perspective must remain realistic, showing accurate paper shadows, edge highlights, and depth.

The final image should look like a single, cohesive origami scene with the subject fully integrated.`},{name:"OUTFIT TRY-ON",category:["FASHION","STYLE","UTILITY"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and generate a 2×2 square grid showing four different complete outfits on the same person. The subject’s pose, face, and environment must remain identical — only the clothing changes.

Each outfit should represent a distinct style (for example: casual, formal, streetwear, business, fantasy, retro, etc.).

Clothing must fit the subject’s body naturally with correct folds, shadows, and proportions.

If external master prompt text is provided (such as era, genre, or theme), use it to guide the outfit designs.

The final image should resemble a digital fashion fitting room.`},{name:"OVER-THE-TOP BEARD",category:["HUMOR","PORTRAIT","TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture of the subject, human or animal, and give them an extremely large, exaggerated beard.

The beard should be far bigger than normal, thick, fluffy, and dramatic — long enough to reach the chest or even lower.

The style can be wild, curly, braided, or oddly shaped, but it should clearly be the main visual focus.

The beard should look real and textured, even if its size is ridiculous.

The final image should look believable but absurd, as if the subject suddenly grew an epic, legendary beard.`},{name:"PAPARAZZI",category:["HUMOR","CELEBRITY","TABLOID","PHOTOGRAPHY"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a grainy, long-lens paparazzi photograph with the subject as the main focus while a famous celebrity accidentally photobombs in the background or periphery, as if the subject is the real celebrity being photographed.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:
• Subject is the MAIN FOCUS and clearly visible in foreground/center
• Famous celebrity appears in background, far away, or at edge of frame
• Celebrity is incidental, not the focus — blurred, walking by, partially visible, or in distance
• Subject appears as the "target" of the paparazzi photo
• Subject doing normal everyday activity
• Subject's face clearly visible and recognizable

CELEBRITY PLACEMENT (CRITICAL):
• Celebrity must be secondary and incidental to the composition
• Options for celebrity placement:
  — Far in background (small, distant figure)
  — Blurred and out of focus behind subject
  — Partially cut off at edge of frame
  — Walking past in background
  — Sitting at table far behind subject
  — Visible through window in background
  — In a crowd, barely noticeable
• Celebrity should be recognizable but NOT the main subject
• Adds to the humor that a real celebrity is ignored while subject is the "star"

CAMERA & PHOTO QUALITY:
• Long telephoto lens compression effect
• Grainy, low-quality image (high ISO noise)
• Subject in focus, celebrity may be slightly blurred
• Awkward framing focused on subject
• Shot from distance (across street, parking lot, through bushes)
• Harsh natural lighting or shadowy
• Authentic paparazzi stalker photography aesthetic

TABLOID ELEMENTS (MANDATORY):
• Large watermark: "TMZ", "EXCLUSIVE", "X17", or similar tabloid agency branding
• Red circle or arrow pointing at SUBJECT (not the celebrity)
• Date and timestamp in corner
• "EXCLUSIVE" banner across top or bottom
• Headline focuses on subject, ignoring the actual celebrity
• Examples:
  — "EXCLUSIVE: New Star Spotted at Coffee Shop!"
  — "BREAKING: Mystery Celebrity Causes Stir!"
  — "WHO IS THIS?! Hollywood's Newest Face!"
• Optional: Small second circle barely noting the real celebrity in background

STYLE:
• Invasive paparazzi photography aesthetic
• Looks stolen/unauthorized
• Candid, unposed moment
• Voyeuristic perspective
• Tabloid journalism production quality
• Focus and framing prioritize subject over actual celebrity

HUMOR ELEMENTS:
• Subject treated as the celebrity while real celebrity is ignored
• Dramatic tabloid presentation of subject as "the star"
• Irony of famous person being incidental background element
• Subject appears completely unaware they're "the famous one"
• Real celebrity casually doing normal things in background, overlooked

FINAL RESULT:
A grainy, long-lens paparazzi photograph with tabloid watermarks focusing on the subject as if they're the celebrity being stalked, while an actual famous person accidentally appears in the background, blurred, distant, or at the edge of frame — completely incidental to the shot. The humor comes from treating the subject as the star while ignoring the real celebrity.`},{name:"PAPER SHADOW BOX",category:["ART","PAPER","3D","LAYERED"],message:"Take a picture and transform the image into a layered paper shadow-box. Multiple cut paper layers creating depth. Soft directional lighting"},{name:"PARALLEL UNIVERSE HISTORY",category:["HISTORICAL","ALTERNATE","EDUCATIONAL"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject at the center of a universally recognizable moment in human history, replacing the original figure with the subject while preserving the significance, symbolism, and emotional weight of the event. The subject must be clearly recognizable and portrayed as the individual performing the defining action of the moment. Do not depict or reference the original historical figure by name or likeness. Instead, recreate the setting, era-appropriate environment, clothing, and atmosphere so the moment is immediately identifiable through visual context alone. Use implicit inference from the subject’s appearance, posture, and expression to select an appropriate historic theme (e.g., leadership, discovery, courage, progress, unity). If externally provided details are supplied, incorporate them as factual context for the moment. Present the image as a clean, collectible flashcard optimized for small screens. Include concise, readable text such as: 
• Title of the historic moment
• Year or era
• One-sentence description of the event’s significance
• A short, respectful caption describing the subject’s role. Ensure cinematic lighting, strong composition, and emotional impact. The final image should feel iconic, respectful, and timeless—like a photograph history forgot to record.`},{name:"PAREIDOLIA FIELD",category:["PSYCHOLOGY","PERCEPTION","ART"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them in a scene where surrounding textures and patterns subtly form faces and expressions through pareidolia.

PAREIDOLIA RULES (CRITICAL):
• Faces must emerge naturally from existing textures such as clouds, foliage, rocks, walls, shadows, or fabric
• Do not introduce literal faces, eyes, or mouths as standalone objects
• The faces should be ambiguous and discoverable rather than immediately obvious

IDENTITY ECHO:
• The emergent faces should subtly echo the subject’s facial features, expression, or emotional state
• Eye spacing, mouth curvature, or overall mood may repeat abstractly in the environment
• Avoid exact duplicates or caricatures

COMPOSITION AND TONE:
• Subject remains clearly visible and normal
• Environmental faces appear secondary and layered
• Ambiguous, unsettling, or whimsical mood depending on context
• No overt horror unless naturally implied

REALISM:
• Photorealistic lighting and textures
• Consistent perspective and scale
• Natural integration into the environment

FINAL RESULT:
The image should feel like a normal photograph at first glance, with hidden faces gradually emerging from the environment the longer the viewer looks, subtly mirroring the subject without obvious intent.`},{name:"PASSPORT PHOTO",category:["UTILITY","DOCUMENT","PROFESSIONAL"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into an official passport photo embedded within a realistic passport identity page.

The subject’s image must appear printed directly onto the passport page as part of the document layout, not as a standalone or floating photo. Integrate the photo naturally into the passport design with proper borders, alignment, and scale consistent with real passports.

Use a plain white or light grey background within the photo area. The subject should have a centered frontal view of the face and shoulders, a neutral expression, and even lighting with no harsh shadows. Maintain clean, sharp focus and accurate proportions.

Surround the photo with realistic passport elements such as text fields, lines, security patterns, microprint textures, and subtle holographic or watermark-style design details (without copying any specific real country’s passport).

Ensure the overall result looks like a legitimate government passport ID page, with the photo clearly integrated into the document and the full page visible within the frame.`},{name:"PATRON SAINT",category:["MASTER PROMPT","RELIGIOUS","SAINT","HOLY"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into a patron saint–style depiction while preserving clear facial likeness and identity. Present the subject in saintly attire with symbolic garments, colors, and iconography. Use a reverent, dignified pose with soft halo lighting and a subtle divine glow, rendered in a classical yet photorealistic aesthetic. Primary information source: If a saint name is provided via externally supplied details, accurately incorporate all historically associated information for that saint, including name, patronage domains, feast day, biographical summary, notable traditions, and fun facts. Do not alter or contradict known historical associations. Secondary enhancement: Use implicit visual inference from the subject’s appearance, clothing, accessories, environment, and expression to enhance symbolism, visual motifs, and flavor text, without overriding factual saint information. Fallback behavior: If no saint name is externally provided, create a clearly labeled symbolic or archetypal “Saint of [inferred theme]” based on implicit inference from the subject. Avoid naming or implying a real historical saint, omit specific feast dates, and present patronage and fun facts as symbolic rather than historical. Design the final image as a compact, mobile-friendly flash card or holy card layout optimized for small screens. Ensure all text is concise, high-contrast, and legible at small sizes, with clear hierarchy and minimal clutter. Maintain visual clarity, balanced composition, and immediate recognizability.  The result should be a full view of the card with a relevant background behind the card."},{name:"PEANUTS",category:["COMICS","CARTOON","VINTAGE"],message:"Take a picture in the style of a Peanuts cartoon strip.

The subject must be MADE OF pennies, not covered in them - every part of their body, face, clothing, and hair should be built from individual copper pennies arranged like tiles or scales to form the three-dimensional shape.

Use pennies at various angles and orientations: some showing Lincoln's head, others showing the memorial or shield back, creating texture and shading through the different faces of the coins. Include pennies in different conditions - bright shiny copper, aged brown, tarnished with green patina, worn smooth - to create dimensional depth, highlights, and shadows.

The pennies should be arranged in overlapping patterns similar to fish scales or roof tiles, building up the volumetric form. Tighter, more densely packed penny arrangements for fine details like facial features; slightly looser arrangements for larger body areas. The circular shape of individual pennies should be visible throughout.

The background and environment should also be constructed from pennies - walls, floor, furniture, all made from stacked and arranged pennies creating a complete penny-constructed world.

Photorealistic lighting with warm copper/reddish-brown metallic tones, highlights catching on raised coin edges, and shadows between overlapping layers. The final image should look like a photograph of an actual physical artwork where literally everything is built from real pennies - a penny mosaic sculpture in three dimensions.`},{name:"PEPPA PIG",category:["CARTOON","ANIMATION","CHILDLIKE","MINIMAL"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a flat, minimal cartoon world inspired by Peppa Pig.

STYLE & CHARACTER RULES:
• Extremely simple shapes and thick outlines
• Flat colors with no shading
• Side-facing or slightly turned characters
• Include multiple simple animal characters

SCENE & TONE:
• Bright, cheerful, and childlike
• Simple outdoor or indoor settings
• Naive perspective and playful composition

The final image should look like a fully composed Peppa Pig–style hand-drawn illustration with the subject and additional characters integrated seamlessly into the world.`},{name:"PEST PANIC",category:["HUMOR","REALISM","STORY"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them in a realistic situation where they appear to be acting irrational, frantic, or unstable due to an unseen or barely visible pest.

PEST SCENARIO SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• SELECT EXACTLY ONE scenario using the RANDOM SEED
• Use LAST TWO DIGITS modulo 8:
  - 0: SWATTING A FLY — subject mid-swing with hand or object, face tense or annoyed, clearly reacting to a small flying insect
  - 1: CAUGHT IN A SPIDER WEB — subject tangled in sticky strands, hands raised awkwardly, visible discomfort or panic
  - 2: AVOIDING A BEE — subject recoiling or dodging with exaggerated caution, eyes wide, body twisted away
  - 3: WASP NEAR THE FACE — subject frozen or flailing in fear, trying not to provoke the insect
  - 4: MOSQUITO ATTACK — subject slapping at arms or neck repeatedly, visibly irritated
  - 5: ANT CRAWLING — subject hopping, shaking clothing, or brushing at legs in alarm
  - 6: GNAT SWARM — subject squinting, waving hands near face, leaning away from invisible cloud
  - 7: TICK DISCOVERY — subject mid-panic realizing a tick is on them, fingers hovering in dread

BEHAVIOR AND EXPRESSION (CRITICAL):
• Subject must appear unaware of how they look to others
• Movements should seem excessive relative to the small threat
• Facial expression should convey panic, disgust, irritation, or paranoia
• Avoid exaggerated cartoon motion or slapstick posing

VISIBILITY RULES:
• The pest may be subtly visible or implied, but must remain small and non-dominant
• The humor must come from the subject’s reaction, not the insect itself

ENVIRONMENT AND REALISM:
• Scene must remain grounded in a normal real-world setting
• Lighting, shadows, and perspective must be consistent
• Natural body mechanics and believable motion blur if appropriate
• No surreal or fantasy elements

TONE:
• Mildly chaotic, socially awkward, and relatable
• Feels like a candid photo taken at the worst possible moment

FINAL RESULT:
The image should look like a real photograph capturing a moment where the subject appears unhinged or overreactive due to a tiny pest, with the humor coming entirely from realistic human behavior and context.`},{name:"PETS LIKE HUMAN",category:["HUMOR","CHARACTER","ANIMALS","TRANSFORMATION"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into what they would look like if they were a dog or a cat.

CORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):
• This is a stylistic, imaginative transformation — not body horror
• The result must feel charming, recognizable, and intentional
• No disturbing or anatomical mashups

ANIMAL SELECTION LOGIC (CRITICAL):
• If NO dog or cat appears in the image:
  – Randomly choose ONE: dog OR cat
  – Transform the subject into that animal archetype

• If a dog or cat IS visible in the image:
  – The subject MUST be transformed to resemble THAT specific animal
  – Use the visible pet as the reference (species, breed traits, coloring, vibe)

SUBJECT → PET TRANSFORMATION RULES (CRITICAL):
• Preserve the subject’s identity through:
  – Eye shape and expression
  – Face shape and proportions (translated into animal form)
  – Hairstyle → fur pattern analogy
  – Personality cues (serious, playful, curious, confident)
• The result should instantly feel like "this is the subject as a dog/cat"
• No grotesque realism, no half-human anatomy

PET STYLE:
• Expressive but natural animal anatomy
• Soft fur, believable posture
• Warm, appealing, and emotionally readable

CLOTHING & ROLE REVERSAL LOGIC (CRITICAL):
• If a dog or cat appears in the image:
  – Dress the dog or cat in the SUBJECT’S clothing style
  – Clothing must be adapted for animals (shirts, jackets, scarves, glasses, hats)
  – No full human outfits or uncomfortable realism

• The transformed subject (now animal-like) should NOT wear human clothes unless the original pet was already dressed

SCENE & COMPOSITION:
• Keep the original environment whenever possible
• Subject (as animal) remains the visual focus

• Lighthearted

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
• No body horror
• No hybrid human limbs

CORE RULE:
• The main subject of the photo must be someone or something else
• The subject must appear unexpectedly in the background or edge of the frame

MULTIPLE SUBJECT RULE (CRITICAL):
• If more than one subject is present, randomly select ONE subject to be the photobomber
• The remaining subject(s) must act as the unaware main focus of the photo
• Only ONE photobomber is allowed per image

PHOTOBOMB BEHAVIOR:
• Exaggerated facial expression, awkward pose, or deliberate attention-seeking
• Leaning into frame, popping up behind someone, or staring directly at camera
• The photobomb should be unmistakable and intentional

COMPOSITION:
• The main subject must remain fully visible and centered
• The photobomber must be partially obscured, off-center, or intruding from the edge
• Do NOT crop the main subject

FINAL RESULT:
The image should clearly read as a normal photo ruined (or improved) by one subject aggressively photobombing it.`},{name:"PHOTO BOOTH STRIP",category:["HUMOR","PHOTOGRAPHY","PORTRAIT"],message:`Take a picture of the subject(s) and turn it into a classic photo booth strip with 3-4 frames vertically aligned.

Each frame should show a different funny or exaggerated pose or expression. Include props like hats, glasses, silly signs, or hand gestures to increase humor.

The subject should be composited into an unexpected, dreamlike, or physically impossible situation. Ensure consistent lighting direction and color temperature across all composited elements for seamless integration. Use realistic shadows, reflections, and perspective matching to make the impossible scene feel photographically authentic. Apply subtle color grading across the entire composition to unify disparate elements into a cohesive whole. The manipulation should be technically flawless - viewers should believe it's a real photograph of an impossible moment. Surreal but photorealistic, masterful digital compositing, reality-bending imagery."},{name:"PHOTO PUZZLE",category:["PUZZLE","JIGSAW","ACTIVITY"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a printable jigsaw puzzle layout. Preserve the original photograph clearly while overlaying visible puzzle piece cut lines across the entire image.

Generate a classic jigsaw pattern with interlocking pieces of varied shapes and sizes. Ensure pieces are large enough to be easily cut out and assembled by hand. Avoid overly small or complex pieces. Keep the image centered and unobstructed so the subject remains recognizable even when divided.

Use clean, high-contrast cut lines that are clearly visible on small screens and when printed. Do not add numbers, text, or labels. The final image should look like a ready-to-print puzzle sheet that can be cut out and assembled in real life.`},{name:"PICTIONARY",category:["PUZZLE","HUMOR","GAME"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a classic Pictionary-style drawing.

Render the subject as a rough, hand-drawn black marker sketch on a clean whiteboard or paper background. The drawing should look like it was made quickly by an amateur player under time pressure — uneven lines, simple shapes, minimal detail, and imperfect proportions.

Preserve just enough of the subject’s pose, silhouette, and key features so the intended idea is still recognizable, but clearly simplified into crude line art rather than a realistic portrait.

Optional visual cues may be included sparingly, such as motion lines, arrows, or simple icons (e.g., sweat drops, exclamation marks) to suggest action or intent, as commonly seen in Pictionary drawings.

Do NOT include written words, letters, numbers, labels, or clues. The image must rely entirely on the drawing to communicate the idea.

Frame the image so the entire drawing surface is visible, as if photographed during a real game of Pictionary. The final result should feel playful, messy, and immediately readable on a small screen.`},{name:"PICTURE PERFECT",category:["PHOTOGRAPHY","ENHANCED","PERFECT"],message:"Take a picture and make it picture perfect - improve lighting, colors, and overall composition.

Expression should be cocky and self-assured.

Limit the color palette to a small, intentional set (approximately 8–24 colors total). Use flat color blocks with hard pixel edges. Shading should be achieved only through pixel placement and color stepping, not softness or blending.

Preserve the subject’s recognizability through simplified shapes, silhouettes, and key features rather than detail. Facial features, if present, should be minimal and symbolic.

Choose a classic pixel-art style inspired by retro video games (8-bit, 16-bit, or early handheld), but do not copy any specific copyrighted game or character.

Ensure the entire pixel artwork is visible, centered, and readable on a small screen.

Render the subject with exaggerated facial features, oversized expressions, and bold ink outlines, like a newspaper editorial cartoon. The subject should be the main caricature, not a background figure.

Invent a fictional, humorous issue, campaign, or cause based on the subject’s appearance, posture, clothing, or environment — or use external master prompt text as the cartoon’s theme. Examples:
• 'The Flatulence Shortage'

Ensure this saying is the **most prominent text element** and fully visible.

Optionally, add small marginal notes, weather predictions, or astronomical observations in smaller text around the edges. Include decorative borders, flourishes, and printer's ornaments typical of colonial printing. Render realistic ink impressions, slight printing misalignments, and other subtle imperfections to emulate a true 18th-century printed page.

Place the page fully within the frame with a relevant background behind it.

Show the open book with two facing pages visible. The pop-up elements should clearly originate from the folds of the pages and extend upward, as if they would collapse flat when the book is closed.

Use realistic paper textures, visible creases, cut edges, and paper thickness. All materials must look like paper—no skin, fabric, plastic, or realistic surfaces.

SURFACE & PRESENTATION:
• Flat wooden panel or plaque
• Minor scorch marks outside main image allowed

FINAL RESULT:
The image must look like a real hand-burned pyrography artwork etched into wood, with natural grain interaction, heat variation, and tactile realism.`},{name:"QR CODE ME",category:["DESIGN","DOCUMENT","HUMOR","ABSTRACT","MASTER PROMPT"],message:`Take a picture and transform it into a QR-code-style graphic where the subject is embedded into the code itself.

The final image should clearly read as a QR code at first glance, using a consistent grid of square black-and-white modules across the entire image. However, when viewed from a moderate distance, the subject’s face or silhouette should become recognizable through natural variations in module density and contrast.

Do NOT place a photographic image inside the QR code. The subject must be constructed entirely from QR-style square modules. No smooth shading, no realistic textures, and no visible photo elements.

Allow the subject’s general facial structure or silhouette to emerge softly from the pattern — eyes, nose, or head shape may be suggested, but only through block clustering and negative space, not sharp outlines or high-detail rendering.

The subject may be centered, but must not overpower the QR pattern. The grid must remain continuous and visually dominant across the entire image.

Include subtle QR-inspired elements such as finder squares or alignment blocks, integrated naturally without framing or spotlighting the subject.

This does NOT need to be a functional or scannable QR code. Treat the QR structure as a visual language, not a technical requirement.

If external master prompt text is provided, let it influence overall density, contrast, or rhythm of the blocks rather than forming readable text.

Use high contrast, clean edges, and a minimal black-and-white palette. The final image should feel clever, modern, and readable on a small screen — a QR code first, with the subject revealed through pattern.`},{name:"QUASI-MUTATION",category:["HORROR","TRANSFORMATION","CREATURE"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject as if undergoing a dramatic mutation into a powerful alternate form. Randomly select a creature or archetype such as a werewolf, Hyde-style transformation, monstrous hybrid, or other iconic mutated form. Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial structure, eyes, expression, and identity while exaggerating musculature, posture, skin texture, or anatomy appropriate to the transformation. Blend human and creature features convincingly so the subject still feels like the same individual mid- or post-mutation. Integrate the subject naturally into the scene with cinematic lighting, dynamic pose, and realistic interaction with the environment. Render the final image with photorealistic detail, dramatic contrast, and a sense of raw power and transformation."},{name:"QUE PASA USA?",category:["TV","COMEDY","CUBAN","RETRO","SITCOM","70S"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a scene from the classic bilingual Cuban-American sitcom 'Que Pasa USA?' from the 1970s.

Place the subject into the iconic Peña family household setting with the show's original characters present in the scene: the grandparents (Abuela and Abuelo), parents (Juana and Joe), and teenagers (Carmen and Joe Jr). The subject should be integrated naturally as if they are a family member, friend, or visitor interacting with the characters.

The setting should capture the show's characteristic environment: the modest Miami household interior with 1970s decor, furniture, and styling. Include authentic period details like vintage appliances, wallpaper patterns, family photos on walls, and the warm, lived-in feel of a Cuban-American home.

Capture the show's signature visual aesthetic: slightly grainy film quality from 1970s television production, warm indoor lighting, and the authentic multicamera sitcom look. Use the color palette and lighting that matches the original show's appearance.

The subject should be dressed in period-appropriate 1970s clothing that fits the scene. Their expression and body language should suggest they're part of a typical sitcom moment - family discussion, comedic misunderstanding, cultural clash between generations, or bilingual conversation.

Other characters in the scene should look authentic to the show - maintaining the actors' appearances from the original series. The interaction should feel natural and capture the show's themes of Cuban-American family life, generational differences, and the immigrant experience.

The final image should look like an actual still frame from the show, with the subject seamlessly integrated into this beloved piece of Cuban-American television history. Include the warm, nostalgic atmosphere and the show's signature blend of English and Spanish cultural elements.`},{name:"R-ROLL",category:["HUMOR","MEME","PHOTOBOMB","RICK ASTLEY"],message:"Take a picture and include a singing Rick Astley standing next to the subject.

• If no profession is provided externally, SELECT EXACTLY ONE profession using the RANDOM SEED
• Choose from a broad range of contemporary professions across industries
• Do not reuse the same profession across renders
• Select professions with distinctive, recognizable attire and settings

The chosen profession should be clearly recognizable through accurate, real-world attire, accessories, and tools associated with that role. Preserve the subject's recognizable facial structure, expression, and identity while adapting hairstyle, clothing, and posture to suit the profession naturally. Place the subject in a realistic environment appropriate to the profession, with consistent lighting, scale, and perspective so the transformation feels authentic rather than like a costume. Ensure the subject appears fully integrated into the scene, as if genuinely working in that profession. Render with photorealistic detail and believable realism.`},{name:"RANGE OF EMOTIONS",category:["HUMOR","PORTRAIT","EMOTION","GRID"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and transform it into a 2×2 grid showing four different emotional states.

Each panel must show the same subject with a different exaggerated emotion chosen from: happy, sad, crying, mad, angry, depressed, shocked, or confused.

ANIMATION FEEL:

FINAL RESULT:
The final image must look like a real Rankin/Bass stop-motion puppet scene from a vintage television special, with the subject fully transformed into a handcrafted puppet character, assigned a clear story role, and presented in either a holiday or year-round setting — warm, nostalgic, and unmistakably classic.`},{name:"RAPPER",category:["MUSIC","HIP HOP","URBAN","CONTEMPORARY"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a modern hip-hop rapper with authentic street style and attitude.

Clothing and style: Oversized designer hoodie or graphic t-shirt, baggy jeans or track pants, fresh sneakers (high-end brands like Jordans, Yeezys), fitted cap or beanie, multiple gold or diamond chains, expensive watch, rings on multiple fingers, possibly designer sunglasses.

ABSOLUTE PRIORITY RULE:

If the subject were removed, the mask would no longer resemble a known fictional character — it would ONLY resemble the subject.

PHYSICAL MASK REQUIREMENTS:
• Visible edges where the mask meets skin at hairline and jawline
• Slight shadow gap between mask and face
• Optional elastic straps, ties, or mounting hardware
• Clearly defined material: porcelain, painted wood, plastic, paper mache, or lacquer

DO NOT alter:
• Hair
• Clothing
• Body
• Pose

FINAL VALIDATION RULE:
If the image looks like the subject wearing a recognizable V for Vendetta mask, IT IS WRONG.

The final image must look like a custom-crafted ceremonial or revolutionary mask made specifically from the subject's own face — not a famous mask placed on them.`},{name:"RENAISSANCE",category:["ART","PAINTING","CLASSIC"],message:"Take a picture in the style of a Renaissance Painting.

The mask MUST be solid white in color. Do NOT use skin tones, flesh colors, beige, pink, or realistic human coloration. The mask should clearly read as a white costume mask.

The mask should be clearly rubbery and costume-like, not realistic or eerie. Use a droopy, stretched face shape with oversized eye holes, exaggerated mouth opening, and slightly uneven proportions. The expression should feel goofy, slack, and intentionally silly rather than threatening.

Subtly adapt the mask to the subject so each render feels unique while staying comedic. Variations may include:
• mouth shape loosely matching the subject’s expression (open, smirking, surprised)
• uneven eye openings influenced by the subject’s eye spacing
• stretched or sagging areas reflecting the subject’s face shape
• molded impressions suggesting glasses or accessories if present

Dress the subject in a loose black hooded robe that looks like a cheap Halloween costume rather than a cinematic outfit. Fabric should appear lightweight, wrinkled, and slightly ill-fitting for comedic effect.

The overall tone must be humorous and absurd, not scary. Do not add blood, weapons, or horror elements. Lighting and composition should feel casual and playful, as if captured during a parody scene.

The final image should immediately read as a Scary Movie–style spoof — goofy, recognizable, and funny — while remaining clear and readable on small screens.`},{name:"SCHOOL BOY / SCHOOL GIRL",category:["HUMOR","TRANSFORMATION","COSTUME"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a school boy or school girl wearing a culturally accurate school uniform.

The subject should appear naturally dressed, not in cosplay. Clothing should fit realistically with proper fabric folds and wear.

Backgrounds may include classrooms, hallways, schoolyards, or chalkboards.

The final image should be humorous due to contrast with the subject’s age or demeanor, but visually realistic.`},{name:"SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK!",category:["HUMOR","CARTOON","EDUCATIONAL","RETRO"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and recreate them as an animated character in the classic Schoolhouse Rock! cartoon style.

The mask should be smooth white with elongated eyes and mouth, subtly shaped by the subject’s face so it feels worn rather than pasted on.

Dress the subject in a flowing black hooded robe inspired by the classic Ghostface costume. Ensure the hood frames the mask naturally, with realistic fabric folds, shadows, and texture. Match lighting, perspective, and depth so the costume integrates seamlessly with the original scene.

Maintain a clean, non-graphic horror aesthetic. Do not add blood, weapons, or violent elements. The final image should feel eerie, iconic, and cinematic while remaining clearly readable on small screens.`},{name:"SECOND TO LAST SUPPER",category:["CLASSICAL ART","RELIGIOUS","PAINTING","ICONIC"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into one of the apostles within Leonardo da Vinci’s 'The Last Supper.'

• Happy Clown — if the subject is smiling or joyful, use bright colors, a rounded red nose, cheerful face paint, and playful costume elements.

Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features and personality while adapting their appearance to the exaggerated, fantastical style of Dr. Seuss characters with playful proportions, quirky shapes, and vibrant colors. The environment should include imaginative, surreal elements typical of Seuss worlds—twisting landscapes, unusual plants, and whimsical architecture.

Break the scene into multiple flat, rigid layers (foreground, midground, background). Each layer must have hard, geometric edges with no feathering, no blur, and no soft transitions. Treat each layer like a physical cutout made from thick card stock or acrylic sheets.

Depth must be created ONLY through layer offset, overlap, scale, and cast shadows — never through photographic depth of field, bokeh, or blur. Shadows should be crisp, directional, and slightly offset to clearly reveal stacking order.

Simplify the subject into bold planar shapes while preserving recognizable silhouette and posture. Remove surface texture and fine photographic detail. Surfaces should appear smooth, matte, and manufactured.

Use a strictly limited calm latte palette: warm ivory, oat beige, sand, almond, soft clay, light mocha, and espresso brown. No saturated colors, no gradients beyond flat tonal steps.

Lighting should feel artificial and diagrammatic, as if lit for a design mockup or museum model, not a real-world photograph.

The final image should resemble a precision-cut, depth-layered design object or editorial poster. It must look constructed, not painted, not photographed, and not illustrated. Ensure all forms remain sharply defined and clearly readable on a small screen. Treat all edges as laser-cut; any softness or blur is an error.`},{name:"SHATTERING",category:["DESTRUCTION","TRANSFORMATION","ABSTRACT","DRAMATIC"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a form breaking apart and shattering like glass, porcelain, or stone.

The subject, background, and environment must all be rendered as chalk drawings — NOT a photo with a chalk filter.

The chalk style should include rough hand-drawn lines, uneven thickness, visible chalk dust, smudges, cracks in the pavement, and faded areas where chalk has been rubbed away.

The subject should appear as a chalk illustration integrated into the pavement, with foreshortening and perspective if appropriate, like classic street chalk art illusions.

Include humorous chalk-written flavor text, arrows, labels, doodles, or annotations interacting with the subject (e.g., pointing out exaggerated features or ridiculous situations).

DO NOT:
• Leave any part of the image photorealistic
• Overlay chalk textures on a real photo
• Create clean digital line art

Lighting should be natural outdoor daylight, with subtle shadows consistent with chalk sitting on pavement.

REAL-WORLD ANCHOR (CRITICAL):
• A portion of the real sidewalk must remain clearly visible and recognizable as an ordinary concrete sidewalk
• Include realistic pavement slabs, seams, cracks, curb edges, and wear typical of a city street
• The image must read as a real photograph taken outdoors in an urban or pedestrian environment

CHALK ILLUSION ART:
• The chalk artwork should occupy a defined area of the sidewalk, not the entire frame
• Create a dramatic anamorphic illusion such as a deep canyon, optical depth effect, portal to another world, staircase descending, bridge crossing a gap, or fantastical creature
• Use exaggerated perspective and foreshortening consistent with professional sidewalk chalk illusions

SUBJECT INTERACTION:
• The subject must appear physically present on the real sidewalk
• The subject should be interacting with the chalk illusion by standing near it, appearing to walk across it, gesturing toward it, posing with it, or playfully engaging with the art
• The subject must clearly exist in the real world, not be drawn in chalk

MATERIAL AND DETAIL:
• Chalk textures must be visible, including dust, smudging, uneven lines, fading, and worn areas
• Color variation and imperfect coverage typical of real chalk on concrete
• The illusion should align correctly with the sidewalk perspective from the camera angle

PHOTOGRAPHIC REALISM:
• Natural outdoor lighting and shadows consistent with the real environment
• No painted backgrounds, flat illustrations, or fully artificial scenes
• Avoid transforming the entire image into chalk art

FINAL RESULT:
The final image must look like a real photograph of a city sidewalk where a skilled street artist has created a large-scale 3D chalk illusion, with the subject physically present on the real pavement and playfully interacting with the artwork.`},{name:"SILHOUETTE",category:["ART","SILHOUETTE","MINIMAL"],message:"Take a picture and convert the subject into a solid black silhouette.

Render the image almost entirely in stark black and white with extreme contrast. Use deep, inky blacks and bright whites with very little midtone gray. Lighting should feel harsh, directional, and dramatic, emphasizing silhouettes, shadows, and negative space.

Allow only one or two selective color accents at most (such as red lips, blood-red elements, a glowing cigarette ember, or neon signage). All other elements must remain strictly monochrome.

Convert the subject into a stylized, high-contrast noir figure with sharp edges, heavy shadowing, and simplified facial features. Preserve recognizability through bold shapes and expression rather than realism.

The environment should feel urban and gritty — rain-soaked streets, fire escapes, alleyways, venetian-blind shadows, brick walls, or smoky interiors. Backgrounds may fade into black to heighten drama.

The final image should resemble a single panel from a dark neo-noir graphic novel. Avoid soft gradients, painterly textures, or photographic realism.

STYLE:
• Slight color shift or fade
• Film grain and analog imperfections
• Subtle dust, scratches, and age artifacts
• Subject remains recognizable

COMPOSITION:
• Slide frame clearly visible
• Dark or neutral background when unprojected

If no location is provided, create a generic charming miniature environment.

The subject should appear as a small figurine integrated into the miniature city scene — not floating, not full-sized, and not dominating the globe.

Render a clear glass sphere with realistic reflections, refraction, highlights, and slight distortion caused by the curved glass. Floating snow particles or glitter should be suspended throughout the globe at varying depths.

Include a visible snow globe base made of plastic or resin, styled like a tourist souvenir. The base should include a decorative plaque or label showing the city or location name (use external master prompt text if provided; otherwise invent a plausible destination name).

Ensure the entire snow globe — glass sphere and base — is fully visible within the frame. The globe should appear photographed on a surface or held in a hand, not floating in space.

Replace cars with people. The tower should be a tall, cylindrical or rectangular glass structure filled with individual human-sized compartments, each containing a different person posed stiffly like a display item. The subject must appear inside one of the compartments, clearly visible, as if they are waiting to be dispensed.

Render the humans as intact, clothed, and calm — no distress, no danger, no violence. The tone should be surreal and comedic, not dark. Humans should feel more like oversized gumballs or capsule toys than trapped people.

Include clear visual cues that this is a vending-style system:
• a large mechanical claw, elevator platform, or rotating carousel mechanism
• numbered slots or bays
• soft interior lighting inside each compartment
• reflections and glass glare to sell realism

Add bold branding on the tower reading “SOUL-VANA” in large, modern lettering. Optional smaller flavor text may include humorous corporate slogans such as:
• “Dispensing Personalities Since Today”
• “Find Your Next You”
• “Low Mileage Humans Available Now”

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to customize:
• the city or location of the tower

The image should look like a genuine Google Maps Street View screenshot taken from a car driving down the street, with white directional navigation arrows on the road, and the subject naturally present in the environment.`},{name:"STRETCH ARMSTRONG",category:["TOY","RETRO","STRETCHED"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a Stretch Armstrong–style action figure made of thick, rubbery material. Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features while adapting them into a toy-like appearance with smooth skin, simplified details, and a slightly exaggerated jaw and expression.

Depict the subject’s arms, legs, or torso being stretched far beyond normal proportions, as if pulled by unseen hands or tension just outside the frame. The stretched areas should look elastic and dense, with believable thickness, subtle surface creases, and realistic stretch deformation rather than thin distortion.

Ensure the subject still resembles a physical toy: solid core, rounded forms, and consistent material texture. Use lighting and shadows that emphasize volume and rubbery sheen. Do not show injuries or damage. The final image should feel playful, nostalgic, and clearly readable on small screens.`},{name:"STRING ART",category:["CRAFT","ANALOG","SCULPTURE","ILLUSTRATION"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a string art portrait, as if the image was created by stretching colored string or thread between fixed nails or anchor points.

CORE CONCEPT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
• The image must be constructed entirely from straight strings
• No drawn lines, paint, or shading
• Curves may only be implied through dense line intersections

MATERIAL RULES (CRITICAL):
• Thin string, thread, or yarn under tension
• Strings connect between visible or implied anchor points
• Overlapping strings create darker regions
• Individual threads must remain distinguishable

STRUCTURAL RULES:
• All lines must be straight
• No curved or hand-drawn strokes
• Perspective and depth created through string density

IDENTITY PRESERVATION:
• Subject’s likeness formed through intersecting lines
• Facial features readable through string density
• Simplification allowed, but identity must remain clear

ANTI-CHEATING RULES:
• NO drawn outlines
• NO painted shading
• NO gradient fills
• NO smooth digital curves

COMPOSITION:
• Flat backing board (wood, cork, or foam)
• Nails or anchor points may be visible at edges
• Strings may fan outward or crisscross densely

LIGHTING & REALISM:
• Lighting reveals string shadows and depth
• Slight irregularity in string spacing allowed

FINAL RESULT:
The image must look like a real string art piece physically assembled from tensioned thread and anchor points, with the subject’s likeness emerging from layered straight lines.`},{name:"STRONGMAN",category:["HUMOR","STRENGTH","EXAGGERATED","PERFORMANCE"],message:"Take a picture and transform the subject into an old-timey circus strongman effortlessly lifting impossibly heavy objects that are visible in the original image. Identify large, heavy objects in the scene - cars, furniture, trees, boulders, appliances, other people - and show the subject lifting them overhead with one hand or holding them in exaggerated strongman poses. Dress the subject in classic strongman attire: handlebar mustache, tight-fitting leopard print or striped unitard/leotard, championship belt, wrist bands, boots. Give them an exaggerated muscular physique with bulging biceps and theatrical pose. Their expression should be confident and theatrical - flexing, showing off, or straining dramatically. The lifted objects should be comically oversized or clearly impossible to lift - entire cars, grand pianos, elephants, statues. Add vintage circus poster aesthetic if desired, or keep it photorealistic showing the absurd strength. Include amazed onlookers in background if present, or circus tent setting. Use dramatic lighting with spotlight effect. The contrast between ordinary objects in the scene and the subject's superhuman ability to lift them should be the humor. Make it look like a vintage strongman performance photo or circus advertisement showing impossible feats of strength."},{name:"STUCK IN WASHING MACHINE",category:["HUMOR","PREDICAMENT","SITCOM"],message:"Take a picture and transform the scene into a classic sitcom predicament: the subject hilariously stuck halfway in a front-loading washing machine. CRITICAL: The subject's face and neck must be visible and outside the washing machine - they are stuck with their head and neck outside while the rest of their body is trapped inside the machine. Show the subject's face clearly with an expression of embarrassment, frustration, or comedic despair. Their upper body should be leaning back or struggling to pull themselves out while their bottom half is wedged in the washing machine opening. The subject might be gripping the sides of the machine trying to extract themselves. Include wet laundry spilling out around them. Place the scene in a laundry room setting with washer/dryer, detergent bottles, laundry baskets. Include a second person looking bewildered, trying to help pull them out by their arms, or laughing at the situation. Use exaggerated physical comedy pose with bright sitcom lighting and that specific 'how did we get into this situation?' energy.

Style the photo to resemble a typical campus ID picture, with slightly awkward framing, flat lighting, mild motion blur or softness, and an unpolished snapshot quality rather than a flattering portrait. Design the ID to resemble the general style of a school or university commonly found near the subject’s location, using a fictional institution name inspired by regional themes. Include placeholder text, sample ID numbers, and decorative elements only. Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features and neutral or mildly awkward expression.

Show them mid-stunt in a dramatic freeze-frame moment - leaping between buildings, diving through explosions, hanging from helicopters, performing precision motorcycle jumps, or executing complex martial arts moves in mid-air. The subject should look intense, focused, and athletic with perfect form despite the danger. Include cinematic action movie elements: explosions with fire and debris in background, shattered glass particles frozen in air, dramatic backlighting, motion blur on fast-moving elements while subject stays sharp, sparks flying, smoke and dust clouds. Use dynamic camera angles - low angle hero shots, dramatic perspectives that emphasize height or danger. Show safety wires digitally removed for that authentic stunt aesthetic. Include protective gear where appropriate - knee pads under ripped jeans, practical costume that allows movement, maybe visible bruises or dirt showing this is real physical work. Capture that Hollywood action movie magic moment with perfect timing, dramatic lighting with rim lights and practical fire sources, and that sense of controlled chaos. Make it look like a frame from a big-budget action film where the subject is the fearless stunt double performing an impossible feat."},{name:"SUBWAY AD",category:["HUMOR","ADVERTISING","SCENE"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them inside a subway car covered in a large, awkward public advertisement featuring them.

The ad should imply the subject has a mildly embarrassing but non-explicit problem such as bad breath, flatulence, excessive sweating, or bladder leaks.

Choose one of these situations at random and build the ad around it:
• Bad breath → a real mint or mouthwash product
• Flatulence → a real digestive aid or deodorizing spray
• Heavy sweating → a real strong deodorant
• Bladder leaks → real protective undergarments

The ad should show the subject’s face with a big headline and product branding, making it look like they are the unfortunate model for the problem.

People around the subject in the subway should be reacting awkwardly, staring, or trying not to laugh.

The final image should look like a real transit advertisement gone terribly wrong, with bold text, clean design, and very public embarrassment.`},{name:"SUPERHERO",category:["COMICS","SUPERHERO","ACTION","HEROIC"],message:`Take a picture and transform the subject into a superhero from various comic publishers, performing a heroic act.

  — Vision: RED synthetic skin

• Preserve eye shape, nose, mouth, facial structure — just change the COLOR/TEXTURE
• Subject still looks like themselves, just in hero's skin color

MASK/HELMET VISIBILITY (CRITICAL):
• If hero wears FULL MASK or FULL HELMET (covering entire face), the mask/helmet MUST be:
  - Removed completely, OR
  - Partially removed (lifted up, pulled back), OR

• Subject's face MUST be clearly visible and recognizable (in appropriate hero color)
• Examples:

• Using hero's signature powers or weapons

Show the subject in a tense standoff, cool walking shot, or intense dialogue moment from the selected film. Include Tarantino's trademark elements: retro aesthetics, vintage cars, diners or seedy locations, bold typography for potential chapter titles. Use high contrast lighting, sunlit exteriors with lens flares, or moody interior amber lighting. Capture his style of making ordinary people look impossibly cool - sharp suits, leather jackets, sunglasses, confident poses.

Transform the subject to match Tim Burton's signature visual style: pale skin with dark shadows under eyes, exaggerated features, elongated proportions, wild unkempt hair (often black with dramatic styling), dramatic makeup with dark eyes, gothic or quirky costume design with striped patterns, mismatched fabrics, Victorian-inspired clothing, or unusual color combinations (black, white, purple, deep reds).

Place the subject within an iconic scene from the chosen film with other characters from that movie present. The environment should capture Burton's distinctive aesthetic: twisted architecture, spiraling designs, forced perspective, gothic elements mixed with whimsy, stark contrast between light and shadow, surreal proportions, and his signature color palette.

The subject should be styled as if they belong in that specific Burton film. Preserve recognizable features while adapting them to Burton's exaggerated, slightly macabre artistic vision.

Lighting should be dramatic with strong contrasts - deep shadows, pools of light, moonlit scenes, or that distinctive Burton glow. The atmosphere should feel both whimsical and slightly dark, fantastical yet melancholic.

The final image should look like an actual still from a Tim Burton film - gothic, whimsical, visually striking, with exaggerated proportions and that unmistakable Burton aesthetic.

• Bubbles cluster and stack to define volume and mass
• Larger bubbles form head, torso, hips
• Medium bubbles form limbs and facial structure
• Tiny bubbles form fingers, eyes, mouth, hair-like mass
• Bubbles touch and compress slightly where they meet

SUBJECT RECOGNITION (ABSTRACTED):

Preserve the subject’s recognizable facial features, proportions, and identity. Carefully match camera angle, focal length, lighting direction, shadows, depth of field, and atmospheric perspective so the illusion feels natural and intentional rather than composited.

REALISM (CRITICAL):
• Photorealistic - must look like actual photograph

The subject's image should be converted into glowing neon tubing and illuminated sign elements. Their facial features, silhouette, and recognizable characteristics should be rendered using bright neon tubes in classic Vegas colors - hot pink, electric blue, bright red, golden yellow, vibrant purple, lime green.

Sign construction details: The neon should have realistic glass tube appearance with visible glowing gas, support brackets and framework visible, bulb marquee borders surrounding the main image, animated chasing lights or blinking elements, possibly text above or below saying the subject's name in classic Vegas marquee lettering.

Mount the sign prominently on the side of an authentic Las Vegas casino building - art deco or mid-century modern architecture, visible in evening or night setting. Include surrounding Vegas context: other neon signs visible in background, palm trees, busy street below with car light trails, other casinos in distance.

Lighting and atmosphere: The scene should be photographed at dusk or night when neon is most vibrant. The sign should be the brightest element, casting colorful glow on the building facade. Include atmospheric haze or slight blur to enhance the neon glow effect. Light from the sign should reflect on surrounding surfaces.

CRITICAL: Preserve exactly the same color, license plate number, location, background, lighting, angle, and any damage or modifications - ONLY change the body style, design elements, and year-specific features of that vehicle model. Keep wheels/rims in period-appropriate style for the new era. Maintain any custom details like racing stripes, decals, or accessories but update them to match the era shift. The transformation should be seamless - same car in same spot with same paint, just from a different decade.

The subject should be the central figure in the scene, interacting directly with a major historical event such as signing an important document, making a dramatic discovery, stopping a disaster, leading a crowd, or inventing something world-changing.

The setting, clothing, and environment should match the historical era being shown, making the scene feel authentic and cinematic.

Use external master prompt text, if provided, to suggest the historical moment or twist.

The tone should be playful and humorous, presenting the subject as an unexpected hero or key figure who altered history in a surprising way.`},{name:"WEATHER CONDITIONS FAVORABLE",category:["ENVIRONMENT","DRAMA","PHOTOGRAPHY"],message:"Take a picture of the subject and generate a four-panel side-by-side composition showing the same subject suffering through four extreme weather conditions.

  – Raindrops, splashes, puddles, and overcast sky must be present

• If converted to SNOW:
  – Objects, ground, rooftops, and surfaces must accumulate snow or ice

First determine the type of subject:

• If the subject is an ANIMAL (dog, cat, bird, etc.): place them into a realistic human situation such as working in an office, driving a car, shopping, cooking, using a phone, or sitting in a café. The animal should behave like a person while still clearly being an animal. Use proper perspective, props, and body positioning so it looks natural and believable.

• If the subject is a HUMAN: transform them into a pet owned by an animal. The human should be on a leash, being carried, sitting in a pet carrier, or being walked by a dog, cat, or other animal. The animal must clearly be the owner and in control.

The scene should be funny but not mean-spirited — playful, surreal, and instantly understandable at a glance.

Maintain realistic lighting, scale, and contact between characters so the interaction feels physically real. The subject must be fully integrated into the scene, not pasted on.

If external master prompt text is provided, use it to influence the setting (for example: city, park, medieval, sci-fi, luxury, etc.).

• a fake taskbar with a clock, system tray, and silly system notifications

Icons should be placed around the subject so they do not block the face or important features.

Depict the subject posed stiffly or passively like merchandise, with a strip of masking tape on their chest or body displaying a handwritten price. The price and text should be humorous, such as 'Still Works,' 'No Returns,' or 'As-Is.'

Include a handwritten yard-sale sign nearby with casual marker lettering and uneven lines. Surround the subject with typical yard sale items like folding tables, boxes, old toys, lamps, or clothes racks.

Use natural daylight and slightly cluttered suburban surroundings to sell the realism. The subject should feel like an object for sale, not a person shopping at the sale.

Ensure the full subject and sale setup are fully visible within the frame. The tone should be funny, awkward, and unmistakably a yard sale scenario.`},{name:"YEARBOOK",category:["SCHOOL","HUMOR","AWKWARD","RETRO"],message:`Take a picture and place the subject on an actual yearbook page with an unflattering, awkward school photo.

YEARBOOK ERA SELECTION (CRITICAL):
• If an external master prompt specifies era or provides student info, USE THAT INFO
• If none is specified, SELECT EXACTLY ONE using the PRE-CALCULATED values

HUMOR EMPHASIS:
• This is the photo you're embarrassed to show people
• The awkward teenage years captured forever
• Peak puberty unfortunate timing
• Fashion and hair disasters of the era
• Everything that could go wrong in a school photo did
• The photo that makes you cringe at reunions
• Parents thought you looked great, you were mortified

FINAL RESULT:
The image should show an actual yearbook page layout with the subject's deliberately unflattering and awkward school portrait photo - complete with bad hair, unfortunate expression, visible braces/acne, ill-fitting clothes, harsh lighting, and all the cringe-inducing elements that make classic yearbook photos both nostalgic and embarrassing, along with student name (from external prompt or generated), activities, and era-appropriate yearbook information.`},{name:"YOU SMELL",category:["HUMOR","SOCIAL","REACTION"],message:`Take a picture of the subject and place them in a public setting such as a bus, office, party, or line.

CORE CONCEPT (CRITICAL):
• This is a FACIAL EXPRESSION transformation only
• The subject must remain fully recognizable
• The humor comes from extreme self-seriousness applied to a mundane moment

BLUE STEEL EXPRESSION RULES (CRITICAL):
• Brows slightly furrowed with intense focus
• Cheeks subtly sucked inward
• Lips pursed or lightly tightened
• Jawline emphasized
• Eyes narrowed with dramatic confidence
• Expression must look intentional and practiced — not distorted

FACIAL INTEGRITY RULES:
• Do NOT alter facial structure, symmetry, or proportions
• Do NOT add wrinkles, makeup, scars, or accessories unless already present
• No cartoon exaggeration
• No facial warping or deformation

POSE & ATTITUDE:
• Head slightly tilted or angled like a fashion pose
• Neck elongated if visible
• Posture confident and poised
• Expression should feel absurdly serious

STYLE & REALISM:
• Photorealistic
• Clean lighting similar to a fashion or candid photo
• No stylization, filters, or painterly effects

HUMOR BOUNDARY (CRITICAL):
• The expression is funny because it is earnest
• No mockery, distortion, or slapstick
• The subject must appear completely unaware of how ridiculous they look

ENVIRONMENT:
• The original environment remains unchanged
• No runway, props, or fashion staging added

GLOBAL RANDOMIZATION DIRECTIVE (CRITICAL - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY):
- Any section labeled RANDOM, SELECT, or CHOOSE must use the PRE-CALCULATED values below
- These values are MANDATORY - you MUST use them for selection
- Do NOT choose based on popularity, visual interest, or defaults
- Do NOT deviate from the calculated selection

RANDOM SEED: ${o}
LAST DIGIT: ${r}
LAST TWO DIGITS: ${s}
LAST THREE DIGITS: ${d}

SELECTION ENFORCEMENT:
- When the preset says "use LAST DIGIT" → use the value ${r} above
- When the preset says "use LAST TWO DIGITS" → use the value ${s} above
- When the preset says "use LAST THREE DIGITS" → use the value ${d} above
- Match the number to the corresponding option in the list
- This is MANDATORY and overrides all other selection preferences`,i.length>0&&(t+=`

SELECTION HISTORY (CRITICAL):
- The following options were recently used for this preset
- AVOID selecting these options - choose something different
- Recently used: ${i.join(", ")}`)}return ne==="1:1"?t+=" Use a square aspect ratio.":ne==="16:9"&&(t+=" Use a square aspect ratio, but pad the image with black bars at top and bottom to simulate a
